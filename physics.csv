5001," (December, 1916)","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"The present book is intended, as far as possible, to give an exact","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"insight into the theory of Relativity to those readers who, from a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus","Einstein, Albert"
5001,of theoretical physics. The work presumes a standard of education,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"corresponding to that of a university matriculation examination, and,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"despite the shortness of the book, a fair amount of patience and force","Einstein, Albert"
5001,of will on the part of the reader. The author has spared himself no,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,pains in his endeavour to present the main ideas in the simplest and,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"most intelligible form, and on the whole, in the sequence and","Einstein, Albert"
5001,connection in which they actually originated. In the interest of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"clearness, it appeared to me inevitable that I should repeat myself","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"frequently, without paying the slightest attention to the elegance of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the presentation. I adhered scrupulously to the precept of that,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"brilliant theoretical physicist L. Boltzmann, according to whom","Einstein, Albert"
5001,matters of elegance ought to be left to the tailor and to the cobbler.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,I make no pretence of having withheld from the reader difficulties,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"which are inherent to the subject. On the other hand, I have purposely","Einstein, Albert"
5001,treated the empirical physical foundations of the theory in a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"""step-motherly"" fashion, so that readers unfamiliar with physics may","Einstein, Albert"
5001,not feel like the wanderer who was unable to see the forest for the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,trees. May the book bring some one a few happy hours of suggestive,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,thought!,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,PHYSICAL MEANING OF GEOMETRICAL PROPOSITIONS,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,In your schooldays most of you who read this book made acquaintance,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"with the noble building of Euclid's geometry, and you remember --","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"perhaps with more respect than love -- the magnificent structure, on","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the lofty staircase of which you were chased about for uncounted hours,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"by conscientious teachers. By reason of our past experience, you would","Einstein, Albert"
5001,certainly regard everyone with disdain who should pronounce even the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,most out-of-the-way proposition of this science to be untrue. But,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,perhaps this feeling of proud certainty would leave you immediately if,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"some one were to ask you: ""What, then, do you mean by the assertion","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"that these propositions are true?"" Let us proceed to give this","Einstein, Albert"
5001,question a little consideration.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Geometry sets out form certain conceptions such as ""plane,"" ""point,""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"and ""straight line,"" with which we are able to associate more or less","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"definite ideas, and from certain simple propositions (axioms) which,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"in virtue of these ideas, we are inclined to accept as ""true."" Then,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"on the basis of a logical process, the justification of which we feel","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"ourselves compelled to admit, all remaining propositions are shown to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"follow from those axioms, i.e. they are proven. A proposition is then","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"correct (""true"") when it has been derived in the recognised manner","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"from the axioms. The question of ""truth"" of the individual geometrical","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"propositions is thus reduced to one of the ""truth"" of the axioms. Now","Einstein, Albert"
5001,it has long been known that the last question is not only unanswerable,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"by the methods of geometry, but that it is in itself entirely without","Einstein, Albert"
5001,meaning. We cannot ask whether it is true that only one straight line,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,goes through two points. We can only say that Euclidean geometry deals,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"with things called ""straight lines,"" to each of which is ascribed the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,property of being uniquely determined by two points situated on it.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"The concept ""true"" does not tally with the assertions of pure","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"geometry, because by the word ""true"" we are eventually in the habit of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"designating always the correspondence with a ""real"" object; geometry,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"however, is not concerned with the relation of the ideas involved in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"it to objects of experience, but only with the logical connection of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,these ideas among themselves.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"It is not difficult to understand why, in spite of this, we feel","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"constrained to call the propositions of geometry ""true."" Geometrical","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"ideas correspond to more or less exact objects in nature, and these","Einstein, Albert"
5001,last are undoubtedly the exclusive cause of the genesis of those,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"ideas. Geometry ought to refrain from such a course, in order to give","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"to its structure the largest possible logical unity. The practice, for","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"example, of seeing in a ""distance"" two marked positions on a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,practically rigid body is something which is lodged deeply in our,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,habit of thought. We are accustomed further to regard three points as,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"being situated on a straight line, if their apparent positions can be","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"made to coincide for observation with one eye, under suitable choice","Einstein, Albert"
5001,of our place of observation.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"If, in pursuance of our habit of thought, we now supplement the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,propositions of Euclidean geometry by the single proposition that two,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,points on a practically rigid body always correspond to the same,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"distance (line-interval), independently of any changes in position to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"which we may subject the body, the propositions of Euclidean geometry","Einstein, Albert"
5001,then resolve themselves into propositions on the possible relative,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,position of practically rigid bodies.* Geometry which has been,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,supplemented in this way is then to be treated as a branch of physics.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"We can now legitimately ask as to the ""truth"" of geometrical","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"propositions interpreted in this way, since we are justified in asking","Einstein, Albert"
5001,whether these propositions are satisfied for those real things we have,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,associated with the geometrical ideas. In less exact terms we can,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"express this by saying that by the ""truth"" of a geometrical","Einstein, Albert"
5001,proposition in this sense we understand its validity for a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,construction with rule and compasses.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Of course the conviction of the ""truth"" of geometrical propositions in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,this sense is founded exclusively on rather incomplete experience. For,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the present we shall assume the ""truth"" of the geometrical","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"propositions, then at a later stage (in the general theory of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"relativity) we shall see that this ""truth"" is limited, and we shall","Einstein, Albert"
5001,consider the extent of its limitation.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,  Notes,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,*) It follows that a natural object is associated also with a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"straight line. Three points A, B and C on a rigid body thus lie in a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"straight line when the points A and C being given, B is chosen such","Einstein, Albert"
5001,that the sum of the distances AB and BC is as short as possible. This,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,incomplete suggestion will suffice for the present purpose.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,THE SYSTEM OF CO-ORDINATES,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,On the basis of the physical interpretation of distance which has been,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"indicated, we are also in a position to establish the distance between","Einstein, Albert"
5001,two points on a rigid body by means of measurements. For this purpose,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"we require a "" distance "" (rod S) which is to be used once and for","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"all, and which we employ as a standard measure. If, now, A and B are","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"two points on a rigid body, we can construct the line joining them","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"according to the rules of geometry ; then, starting from A, we can","Einstein, Albert"
5001,mark off the distance S time after time until we reach B. The number,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of these operations required is the numerical measure of the distance,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,AB. This is the basis of all measurement of length. *,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Every description of the scene of an event or of the position of an,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,object in space is based on the specification of the point on a rigid,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,body (body of reference) with which that event or object coincides.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"This applies not only to scientific description, but also to everyday","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"life. If I analyse the place specification "" Times Square, New York,""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,**A I arrive at the following result. The earth is the rigid body,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"to which the specification of place refers; "" Times Square, New York,""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"is a well-defined point, to which a name has been assigned, and with","Einstein, Albert"
5001,which the event coincides in space.**B,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,This primitive method of place specification deals only with places on,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the surface of rigid bodies, and is dependent on the existence of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,points on this surface which are distinguishable from each other. But,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,we can free ourselves from both of these limitations without altering,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the nature of our specification of position. If, for instance, a cloud","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"is hovering over Times Square, then we can determine its position","Einstein, Albert"
5001,relative to the surface of the earth by erecting a pole,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"perpendicularly on the Square, so that it reaches the cloud. The","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"length of the pole measured with the standard measuring-rod, combined","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"with the specification of the position of the foot of the pole,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,supplies us with a complete place specification. On the basis of this,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"illustration, we are able to see the manner in which a refinement of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the conception of position has been developed.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"(a) We imagine the rigid body, to which the place specification is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"referred, supplemented in such a manner that the object whose position","Einstein, Albert"
5001,we require is reached by. the completed rigid body.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"(b) In locating the position of the object, we make use of a number","Einstein, Albert"
5001,(here the length of the pole measured with the measuring-rod) instead,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of designated points of reference.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,(c) We speak of the height of the cloud even when the pole which,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,reaches the cloud has not been erected. By means of optical,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"observations of the cloud from different positions on the ground, and","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"taking into account the properties of the propagation of light, we","Einstein, Albert"
5001,determine the length of the pole we should have required in order to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,reach the cloud.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"From this consideration we see that it will be advantageous if, in the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"description of position, it should be possible by means of numerical","Einstein, Albert"
5001,measures to make ourselves independent of the existence of marked,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,positions (possessing names) on the rigid body of reference. In the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,physics of measurement this is attained by the application of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Cartesian system of co-ordinates.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,This consists of three plane surfaces perpendicular to each other and,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,rigidly attached to a rigid body. Referred to a system of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"co-ordinates, the scene of any event will be determined (for the main","Einstein, Albert"
5001,part) by the specification of the lengths of the three perpendiculars,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"or co-ordinates (x, y, z) which can be dropped from the scene of the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,event to those three plane surfaces. The lengths of these three,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,perpendiculars can be determined by a series of manipulations with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,rigid measuring-rods performed according to the rules and methods laid,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,down by Euclidean geometry.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"In practice, the rigid surfaces which constitute the system of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"co-ordinates are generally not available ; furthermore, the magnitudes","Einstein, Albert"
5001,of the co-ordinates are not actually determined by constructions with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"rigid rods, but by indirect means. If the results of physics and","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"astronomy are to maintain their clearness, the physical meaning of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,specifications of position must always be sought in accordance with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the above considerations. ***,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,We thus obtain the following result: Every description of events in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,space involves the use of a rigid body to which such events have to be,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,referred. The resulting relationship takes for granted that the laws,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of Euclidean geometry hold for ""distances;"" the ""distance"" being","Einstein, Albert"
5001,represented physically by means of the convention of two marks on a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,rigid body.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,  Notes,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,* Here we have assumed that there is nothing left over i.e. that,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the measurement gives a whole number. This difficulty is got over by,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the use of divided measuring-rods, the introduction of which does not","Einstein, Albert"
5001,demand any fundamentally new method.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"**A Einstein used ""Potsdamer Platz, Berlin"" in the original text.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"In the authorised translation this was supplemented with ""Tranfalgar","Einstein, Albert"

5001,this is the most well known/identifiable location to English speakers,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,in the present day. [Note by the janitor.],"Einstein, Albert"

5001,**B It is not necessary here to investigate further the significance,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of the expression ""coincidence in space."" This conception is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,sufficiently obvious to ensure that differences of opinion are,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,scarcely likely to arise as to its applicability in practice.,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,The purpose of mechanics is to describe how bodies change their,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"position in space with ""time."" I should load my conscience with grave","Einstein, Albert"
5001,sins against the sacred spirit of lucidity were I to formulate the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"aims of mechanics in this way, without serious reflection and detailed","Einstein, Albert"
5001,explanations. Let us proceed to disclose these sins.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"It is not clear what is to be understood here by ""position"" and","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"""space."" I stand at the window of a railway carriage which is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"travelling uniformly, and drop a stone on the embankment, without","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"throwing it. Then, disregarding the influence of the air resistance, I","Einstein, Albert"
5001,see the stone descend in a straight line. A pedestrian who observes,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the misdeed from the footpath notices that the stone falls to earth in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"a parabolic curve. I now ask: Do the ""positions"" traversed by the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"stone lie ""in reality"" on a straight line or on a parabola? Moreover,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"what is meant here by motion ""in space"" ? From the considerations of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the previous section the answer is self-evident. In the first place we,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"entirely shun the vague word ""space,"" of which, we must honestly","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"acknowledge, we cannot form the slightest conception, and we replace","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"it by ""motion relative to a practically rigid body of reference."" The","Einstein, Albert"
5001,positions relative to the body of reference (railway carriage or,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,embankment) have already been defined in detail in the preceding,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"section. If instead of "" body of reference "" we insert "" system of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"co-ordinates,"" which is a useful idea for mathematical description, we","Einstein, Albert"
5001,are in a position to say : The stone traverses a straight line,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"relative to a system of co-ordinates rigidly attached to the carriage,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,but relative to a system of co-ordinates rigidly attached to the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,ground (embankment) it describes a parabola. With the aid of this,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,example it is clearly seen that there is no such thing as an,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"independently existing trajectory (lit. ""path-curve""*), but only","Einstein, Albert"
5001,a trajectory relative to a particular body of reference.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"In order to have a complete description of the motion, we must specify","Einstein, Albert"
5001,how the body alters its position with time ; i.e. for every point on,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the trajectory it must be stated at what time the body is situated,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,there. These data must be supplemented by such a definition of time,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"that, in virtue of this definition, these time-values can be regarded","Einstein, Albert"
5001,essentially as magnitudes (results of measurements) capable of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,observation. If we take our stand on the ground of classical,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"mechanics, we can satisfy this requirement for our illustration in the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,following manner. We imagine two clocks of identical construction ;,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the man at the railway-carriage window is holding one of them, and the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,man on the footpath the other. Each of the observers determines the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,position on his own reference-body occupied by the stone at each tick,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of the clock he is holding in his hand. In this connection we have not,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,taken account of the inaccuracy involved by the finiteness of the,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,THE GALILEIAN SYSTEM OF CO-ORDINATES,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"As is well known, the fundamental law of the mechanics of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Galilei-Newton, which is known as the law of inertia, can be stated","Einstein, Albert"
5001,thus: A body removed sufficiently far from other bodies continues in a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line. This law not,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"only says something about the motion of the bodies, but it also","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"indicates the reference-bodies or systems of coordinates, permissible","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"in mechanics, which can be used in mechanical description. The visible","Einstein, Albert"
5001,fixed stars are bodies for which the law of inertia certainly holds to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,a high degree of approximation. Now if we use a system of co-ordinates,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"which is rigidly attached to the earth, then, relative to this system,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,every fixed star describes a circle of immense radius in the course of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"an astronomical day, a result which is opposed to the statement of the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,law of inertia. So that if we adhere to this law we must refer these,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,motions only to systems of coordinates relative to which the fixed,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,stars do not move in a circle. A system of co-ordinates of which the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,state of motion is such that the law of inertia holds relative to it,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"is called a "" Galileian system of co-ordinates."" The laws of the","Einstein, Albert"

5001,THE PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,(IN THE RESTRICTED SENSE),"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"In order to attain the greatest possible clearness, let us return to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,our example of the railway carriage supposed to be travelling,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"uniformly. We call its motion a uniform translation (""uniform"" because","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"it is of constant velocity and direction, "" translation "" because","Einstein, Albert"
5001,although the carriage changes its position relative to the embankment,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,yet it does not rotate in so doing). Let us imagine a raven flying,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"through the air in such a manner that its motion, as observed from the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"embankment, is uniform and in a straight line. If we were to observe","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the flying raven from the moving railway carriage. we should find that,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the motion of the raven would be one of different velocity and,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"direction, but that it would still be uniform and in a straight line.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,Expressed in an abstract manner we may say : If a mass m is moving,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"uniformly in a straight line with respect to a co-ordinate system K,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,then it will also be moving uniformly and in a straight line relative,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,to a second co-ordinate system K1 provided that the latter is,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,executing a uniform translatory motion with respect to K. In,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"accordance with the discussion contained in the preceding section, it","Einstein, Albert"
5001,follows that:,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,If K is a Galileian co-ordinate system. then every other co-ordinate,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"system K' is a Galileian one, when, in relation to K, it is in a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,condition of uniform motion of translation. Relative to K1 the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,mechanical laws of Galilei-Newton hold good exactly as they do with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,respect to K.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,We advance a step farther in our generalisation when we express the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"tenet thus: If, relative to K, K1 is a uniformly moving co-ordinate","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"system devoid of rotation, then natural phenomena run their course","Einstein, Albert"
5001,with respect to K1 according to exactly the same general laws as with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,respect to K. This statement is called the principle of relativity (in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the restricted sense).,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,As long as one was convinced that all natural phenomena were capable,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of representation with the help of classical mechanics, there was no","Einstein, Albert"
5001,need to doubt the validity of this principle of relativity. But in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,view of the more recent development of electrodynamics and optics it,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,became more and more evident that classical mechanics affords an,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,insufficient foundation for the physical description of all natural,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,phenomena. At this juncture the question of the validity of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"principle of relativity became ripe for discussion, and it did not","Einstein, Albert"
5001,appear impossible that the answer to this question might be in the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,negative.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Nevertheless, there are two general facts which at the outset speak","Einstein, Albert"
5001,very much in favour of the validity of the principle of relativity.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Even though classical mechanics does not supply us with a sufficiently,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,broad basis for the theoretical presentation of all physical,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"phenomena, still we must grant it a considerable measure of "" truth,""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,since it supplies us with the actual motions of the heavenly bodies,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,with a delicacy of detail little short of wonderful. The principle of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,relativity must therefore apply with great accuracy in the domain of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,mechanics. But that a principle of such broad generality should hold,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"with such exactness in one domain of phenomena, and yet should be","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"invalid for another, is a priori not very probable.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"We now proceed to the second argument, to which, moreover, we shall","Einstein, Albert"
5001,return later. If the principle of relativity (in the restricted sense),"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"does not hold, then the Galileian co-ordinate systems K, K1, K2, etc.,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"which are moving uniformly relative to each other, will not be","Einstein, Albert"
5001,equivalent for the description of natural phenomena. In this case we,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,should be constrained to believe that natural laws are capable of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"being formulated in a particularly simple manner, and of course only","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"on condition that, from amongst all possible Galileian co-ordinate","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"systems, we should have chosen one (K[0]) of a particular state of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,motion as our body of reference. We should then be justified (because,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of its merits for the description of natural phenomena) in calling,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"this system "" absolutely at rest,"" and all other Galileian systems K ""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"in motion."" If, for instance, our embankment were the system K[0] then","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"our railway carriage would be a system K, relative to which less","Einstein, Albert"
5001,simple laws would hold than with respect to K[0]. This diminished,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,simplicity would be due to the fact that the carriage K would be in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"motion (i.e.""really"")with respect to K[0]. In the general laws of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"nature which have been formulated with reference to K, the magnitude","Einstein, Albert"
5001,and direction of the velocity of the carriage would necessarily play a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"part. We should expect, for instance, that the note emitted by an","Einstein, Albert"
5001,organpipe placed with its axis parallel to the direction of travel,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,would be different from that emitted if the axis of the pipe were,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,placed perpendicular to this direction.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Now in virtue of its motion in an orbit round the sun, our earth is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,comparable with a railway carriage travelling with a velocity of about,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,30 kilometres per second. If the principle of relativity were not,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,valid we should therefore expect that the direction of motion of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"earth at any moment would enter into the laws of nature, and also that","Einstein, Albert"
5001,physical systems in their behaviour would be dependent on the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,orientation in space with respect to the earth. For owing to the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,alteration in direction of the velocity of revolution of the earth in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the course of a year, the earth cannot be at rest relative to the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"hypothetical system K[0] throughout the whole year. However, the most","Einstein, Albert"
5001,careful observations have never revealed such anisotropic properties,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"in terrestrial physical space, i.e. a physical non-equivalence of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,different directions. This is very powerful argument in favour of the,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Let us suppose our old friend the railway carriage to be travelling,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"along the rails with a constant velocity v, and that a man traverses","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the length of the carriage in the direction of travel with a velocity,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"w. How quickly or, in other words, with what velocity W does the man","Einstein, Albert"
5001,advance relative to the embankment during the process ? The only,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,possible answer seems to result from the following consideration: If,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the man were to stand still for a second, he would advance relative to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the embankment through a distance v equal numerically to the velocity,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of the carriage. As a consequence of his walking, however, he","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"traverses an additional distance w relative to the carriage, and hence","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"also relative to the embankment, in this second, the distance w being","Einstein, Albert"
5001,numerically equal to the velocity with which he is walking. Thus in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,total be covers the distance W=v+w relative to the embankment in the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"second considered. We shall see later that this result, which","Einstein, Albert"
5001,expresses the theorem of the addition of velocities employed in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"classical mechanics, cannot be maintained ; in other words, the law","Einstein, Albert"
5001,that we have just written down does not hold in reality. For the time,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,LAW OF PROPAGATION OF LIGHT WITH THE,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,There is hardly a simpler law in physics than that according to which,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"light is propagated in empty space. Every child at school knows, or","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"believes he knows, that this propagation takes place in straight lines","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"with a velocity c= 300,000 km./sec. At all events we know with great","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"exactness that this velocity is the same for all colours, because if","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"this were not the case, the minimum of emission would not be observed","Einstein, Albert"
5001,simultaneously for different colours during the eclipse of a fixed,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,star by its dark neighbour. By means of similar considerations based,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"on observa- tions of double stars, the Dutch astronomer De Sitter was","Einstein, Albert"
5001,also able to show that the velocity of propagation of light cannot,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,depend on the velocity of motion of the body emitting the light. The,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,assumption that this velocity of propagation is dependent on the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"direction ""in space"" is in itself improbable.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"In short, let us assume that the simple law of the constancy of the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,velocity of light c (in vacuum) is justifiably believed by the child,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,at school. Who would imagine that this simple law has plunged the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,conscientiously thoughtful physicist into the greatest intellectual,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,difficulties? Let us consider how these difficulties arise.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Of course we must refer the process of the propagation of light (and,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,indeed every other process) to a rigid reference-body (co-ordinate,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,system). As such a system let us again choose our embankment. We shall,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,imagine the air above it to have been removed. If a ray of light be,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"sent along the embankment, we see from the above that the tip of the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,ray will be transmitted with the velocity c relative to the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,embankment. Now let us suppose that our railway carriage is again,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"travelling along the railway lines with the velocity v, and that its","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"direction is the same as that of the ray of light, but its velocity of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,course much less. Let us inquire about the velocity of propagation of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the ray of light relative to the carriage. It is obvious that we can,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"here apply the consideration of the previous section, since the ray of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,light plays the part of the man walking along relatively to the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,carriage. The velocity w of the man relative to the embankment is here,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,replaced by the velocity of light relative to the embankment. w is the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"required velocity of light with respect to the carriage, and we have","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,                               w = c-v.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,The velocity of propagation ot a ray of light relative to the carriage,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,thus comes cut smaller than c.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,But this result comes into conflict with the principle of relativity,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"set forth in Section V. For, like every other general law of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"nature, the law of the transmission of light in vacuo [in vacuum]","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"must, according to the principle of relativity, be the same for the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,railway carriage as reference-body as when the rails are the body of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"reference. But, from our above consideration, this would appear to be","Einstein, Albert"
5001,impossible. If every ray of light is propagated relative to the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"embankment with the velocity c, then for this reason it would appear","Einstein, Albert"
5001,that another law of propagation of light must necessarily hold with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,respect to the carriage -- a result contradictory to the principle of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,relativity.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,In view of this dilemma there appears to be nothing else for it than,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,to abandon either the principle of relativity or the simple law of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,propagation of light in vacuo. Those of you who have carefully,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,followed the preceding discussion are almost sure to expect that we,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"should retain the principle of relativity, which appeals so","Einstein, Albert"
5001,convincingly to the intellect because it is so natural and simple. The,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,law of the propagation of light in vacuo would then have to be,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,replaced by a more complicated law conformable to the principle of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"relativity. The development of theoretical physics shows, however,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,that we cannot pursue this course. The epoch-making theoretical,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,investigations of H. A. Lorentz on the electrodynamical and optical,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,phenomena connected with moving bodies show that experience in this,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"domain leads conclusively to a theory of electromagnetic phenomena, of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,which the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo is a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,necessary consequence. Prominent theoretical physicists were theref,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"ore more inclined to reject the principle of relativity, in spite of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the fact that no empirical data had been found which were,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,contradictory to this principle.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,At this juncture the theory of relativity entered the arena. As a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"result of an analysis of the physical conceptions of time and space,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,it became evident that in realily there is not the least,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,incompatibilitiy between the principle of relativity and the law of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"propagation of light, and that by systematically holding fast to both","Einstein, Albert"
5001,these laws a logically rigid theory could be arrived at. This theory,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,has been called the special theory of relativity to distinguish it,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"from the extended theory, with which we shall deal later. In the","Einstein, Albert"

5001,Lightning has struck the rails on our railway embankment at two places,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,A and B far distant from each other. I make the additional assertion,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,that these two lightning flashes occurred simultaneously. If I ask you,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"whether there is sense in this statement, you will answer my question","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"with a decided ""Yes."" But if I now approach you with the request to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"explain to me the sense of the statement more precisely, you find","Einstein, Albert"
5001,after some consideration that the answer to this question is not so,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,easy as it appears at first sight.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"After some time perhaps the following answer would occur to you: ""The","Einstein, Albert"
5001,significance of the statement is clear in itself and needs no further,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,explanation; of course it would require some consideration if I were,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,to be commissioned to determine by observations whether in the actual,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"case the two events took place simultaneously or not."" I cannot be","Einstein, Albert"
5001,satisfied with this answer for the following reason. Supposing that as,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,a result of ingenious considerations an able meteorologist were to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,discover that the lightning must always strike the places A and B,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"simultaneously, then we should be faced with the task of testing","Einstein, Albert"
5001,whether or not this theoretical result is in accordance with the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,reality. We encounter the same difficulty with all physical statements,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"in which the conception "" simultaneous "" plays a part. The concept","Einstein, Albert"
5001,does not exist for the physicist until he has the possibility of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,discovering whether or not it is fulfilled in an actual case. We thus,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,require a definition of simultaneity such that this definition,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"supplies us with the method by means of which, in the present case, he","Einstein, Albert"
5001,can decide by experiment whether or not both the lightning strokes,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"occurred simultaneously. As long as this requirement is not satisfied,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,I allow myself to be deceived as a physicist (and of course the same,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"applies if I am not a physicist), when I imagine that I am able to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,attach a meaning to the statement of simultaneity. (I would ask the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,reader not to proceed farther until he is fully convinced on this,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,point.),"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,After thinking the matter over for some time you then offer the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,following suggestion with which to test simultaneity. By measuring,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"along the rails, the connecting line AB should be measured up and an","Einstein, Albert"
5001,observer placed at the mid-point M of the distance AB. This observer,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,should be supplied with an arrangement (e.g. two mirrors inclined at,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,90^0) which allows him visually to observe both places A and B at the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,same time. If the observer perceives the two flashes of lightning at,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the same time, then they are simultaneous.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"I am very pleased with this suggestion, but for all that I cannot","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"regard the matter as quite settled, because I feel constrained to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,raise the following objection:,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"""Your definition would certainly be right, if only I knew that the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,light by means of which the observer at M perceives the lightning,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,flashes travels along the length A arrow M with the same velocity as,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,along the length B arrow M. But an examination of this supposition,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,would only be possible if we already had at our disposal the means of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,measuring time. It would thus appear as though we were moving here in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"a logical circle.""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,After further consideration you cast a somewhat disdainful glance at,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,me -- and rightly so -- and you declare:,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"""I maintain my previous definition nevertheless, because in reality it","Einstein, Albert"
5001,assumes absolutely nothing about light. There is only one demand to be,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"made of the definition of simultaneity, namely, that in every real","Einstein, Albert"
5001,case it must supply us with an empirical decision as to whether or not,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the conception that has to be defined is fulfilled. That my definition,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,satisfies this demand is indisputable. That light requires the same,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,time to traverse the path A arrow M as for the path B arrow M is in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,reality neither a supposition nor a hypothesis about the physical,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"nature of light, but a stipulation which I can make of my own freewill","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"in order to arrive at a definition of simultaneity.""","Einstein, Albert"

5001,the one clock is simultaneous (in the above sense) with the same,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,Up to now our considerations have been referred to a particular body,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of reference, which we have styled a "" railway embankment."" We suppose","Einstein, Albert"
5001,a very long train travelling along the rails with the constant,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,velocity v and in the direction indicated in Fig 1. People travelling,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,in this train will with a vantage view the train as a rigid,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,reference to the train. Then every event which takes place along the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,line also takes place at a particular point of the train. Also the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,definition of simultaneity can be given relative to the train in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,exactly the same way as with respect to the embankment. As a natural,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"consequence, however, the following question arises :","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Are two events (e.g. the two strokes of lightning A and B) which are,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,simultaneous with reference to the railway embankment also,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,simultaneous relatively to the train? We shall show directly that the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,answer must be in the negative.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,When we say that the lightning strokes A and B are simultaneous with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"respect to be embankment, we mean: the rays of light emitted at the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"places A and B, where the lightning occurs, meet each other at the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,mid-point M of the length A arrow B of the embankment. But the events,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,A and B also correspond to positions A and B on the train. Let M1 be,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the mid-point of the distance A arrow B on the travelling train. Just,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"when the flashes (as judged from the embankment) of lightning occur,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,this point M1 naturally coincides with the point M but it moves,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,towards the right in the diagram with the velocity v of the train. If,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,an observer sitting in the position M1 in the train did not possess,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"this velocity, then he would remain permanently at M, and the light","Einstein, Albert"
5001,rays emitted by the flashes of lightning A and B would reach him,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"simultaneously, i.e. they would meet just where he is situated. Now in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,reality (considered with reference to the railway embankment) he is,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"hastening towards the beam of light coming from B, whilst he is riding","Einstein, Albert"
5001,on ahead of the beam of light coming from A. Hence the observer will,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,see the beam of light emitted from B earlier than he will see that,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,emitted from A. Observers who take the railway train as their,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,reference-body must therefore come to the conclusion that the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,lightning flash B took place earlier than the lightning flash A. We,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,thus arrive at the important result:,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Events which are simultaneous with reference to the embankment are not,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"simultaneous with respect to the train, and vice versa (relativity of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,simultaneity). Every reference-body (co-ordinate system) has its own,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,particular time ; unless we are told the reference-body to which the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"statement of time refers, there is no meaning in a statement of the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,time of an event.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Now before the advent of the theory of relativity it had always,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,tacitly been assumed in physics that the statement of time had an,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"absolute significance, i.e. that it is independent of the state of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,motion of the body of reference. But we have just seen that this,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,assumption is incompatible with the most natural definition of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"simultaneity; if we discard this assumption, then the conflict between","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the law of the propagation of light in vacuo and the principle of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,relativity (developed in Section 7) disappears.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"We were led to that conflict by the considerations of Section 6,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,which are now no longer tenable. In that section we concluded that the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"man in the carriage, who traverses the distance w per second relative","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"to the carriage, traverses the same distance also with respect to the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"embankment in each second of time. But, according to the foregoing","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"considerations, the time required by a particular occurrence with","Einstein, Albert"
5001,respect to the carriage must not be considered equal to the duration,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of the same occurrence as judged from the embankment (as,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,reference-body). Hence it cannot be contended that the man in walking,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,travels the distance w relative to the railway line in a time which is,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,equal to one second as judged from the embankment.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Moreover, the considerations of Section 6 are based on yet a second","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"assumption, which, in the light of a strict consideration, appears to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"be arbitrary, although it was always tacitly made even before the","Einstein, Albert"

5001,ON THE RELATIVITY OF THE CONCEPTION OF DISTANCE,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Let us consider two particular points on the train * travelling,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"along the embankment with the velocity v, and inquire as to their","Einstein, Albert"
5001,distance apart. We already know that it is necessary to have a body of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"reference for the measurement of a distance, with respect to which","Einstein, Albert"
5001,body the distance can be measured up. It is the simplest plan to use,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the train itself as reference-body (co-ordinate system). An observer,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,in the train measures the interval by marking off his measuring-rod in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,a straight line (e.g. along the floor of the carriage) as many times,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,as is necessary to take him from the one marked point to the other.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Then the number which tells us how often the rod has to be laid down,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,is the required distance.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,It is a different matter when the distance has to be judged from the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,railway line. Here the following method suggests itself. If we call,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,A^1 and B^1 the two points on the train whose distance apart is,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"required, then both of these points are moving with the velocity v","Einstein, Albert"
5001,along the embankment. In the first place we require to determine the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,points A and B of the embankment which are just being passed by the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,two points A^1 and B^1 at a particular time t -- judged from the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,embankment. These points A and B of the embankment can be determined,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,by applying the definition of time given in Section 8. The distance,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,between these points A and B is then measured by repeated application,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of thee measuring-rod along the embankment.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,A priori it is by no means certain that this last measurement will,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,supply us with the same result as the first. Thus the length of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,train as measured from the embankment may be different from that,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,obtained by measuring in the train itself. This circumstance leads us,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,to a second objection which must be raised against the apparently,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"obvious consideration of Section 6. Namely, if the man in the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,carriage covers the distance w in a unit of time -- measured from the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"train, -- then this distance -- as measured from the embankment -- is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,not necessarily also equal to w.,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,The results of the last three sections show that the apparent,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,incompatibility of the law of propagation of light with the principle,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of relativity (Section 7) has been derived by means of a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,consideration which borrowed two unjustifiable hypotheses from,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,classical mechanics; these are as follows:,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,(1) The time-interval (time) between two events is independent of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,condition of motion of the body of reference.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,(2) The space-interval (distance) between two points of a rigid body,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,is independent of the condition of motion of the body of reference.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"If we drop these hypotheses, then the dilemma of Section 7","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"disappears, because the theorem of the addition of velocities derived","Einstein, Albert"
5001,in Section 6 becomes invalid. The possibility presents itself that,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the law of the propagation of light in vacuo may be compatible with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the principle of relativity, and the question arises: How have we to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,modify the considerations of Section 6 in order to remove the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,apparent disagreement between these two fundamental results of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,experience? This question leads to a general one. In the discussion of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Section 6 we have to do with places and times relative both to the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,train and to the embankment. How are we to find the place and time of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"an event in relation to the train, when we know the place and time of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the event with respect to the railway embankment ? Is there a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,thinkable answer to this question of such a nature that the law of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,transmission of light in vacuo does not contradict the principle of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,relativity ? In other words : Can we conceive of a relation between,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,place and time of the individual events relative to both,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"reference-bodies, such that every ray of light possesses the velocity","Einstein, Albert"
5001,of transmission c relative to the embankment and relative to the train,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"? This question leads to a quite definite positive answer, and to a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,perfectly definite transformation law for the space-time magnitudes of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,an event when changing over from one body of reference to another.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Before we deal with this, we shall introduce the following incidental","Einstein, Albert"
5001,consideration. Up to the present we have only considered events taking,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"place along the embankment, which had mathematically to assume the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,function of a straight line. In the manner indicated in Section 2,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,we can imagine this reference-body supplemented laterally and in a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"vertical direction by means of a framework of rods, so that an event","Einstein, Albert"
5001,which takes place anywhere can be localised with reference to this,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"framework. Fig. 2 Similarly, we can imagine the train travelling with","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the velocity v to be continued across the whole of space, so that","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"every event, no matter how far off it may be, could also be localised","Einstein, Albert"
5001,with respect to the second framework. Without committing any,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"fundamental error, we can disregard the fact that in reality these","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"frameworks would continually interfere with each other, owing to the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,impenetrability of solid bodies. In every such framework we imagine,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"three surfaces perpendicular to each other marked out, and designated","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"as "" co-ordinate planes "" ("" co-ordinate system ""). A co-ordinate","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"system K then corresponds to the embankment, and a co-ordinate system","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"K' to the train. An event, wherever it may have taken place, would be","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"fixed in space with respect to K by the three perpendiculars x, y, z","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"on the co-ordinate planes, and with regard to time by a time value t.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Relative to K1, the same event would be fixed in respect of space and","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"time by corresponding values x1, y1, z1, t1, which of course are not","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"identical with x, y, z, t. It has already been set forth in detail how","Einstein, Albert"
5001,these magnitudes are to be regarded as results of physical,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,measurements.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Obviously our problem can be exactly formulated in the following,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"manner. What are the values x1, y1, z1, t1, of an event with respect","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"to K1, when the magnitudes x, y, z, t, of the same event with respect","Einstein, Albert"
5001,to K are given ? The relations must be so chosen that the law of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,transmission of light in vacuo is satisfied for one and the same ray,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of light (and of course for every ray) with respect to K and K1. For,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the relative orientation in space of the co-ordinate systems indicated,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,Now in practice we can move clocks and measuring-rods only with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,velocities that are small compared with the velocity of light; hence,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,we shall hardly be able to compare the results of the previous section,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"directly with the reality. But, on the other hand, these results must","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"strike you as being very singular, and for that reason I shall now","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"draw another conclusion from the theory, one which can easily be","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"derived from the foregoing considerations, and which has been most","Einstein, Albert"
5001,elegantly confirmed by experiment.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,In Section 6 we derived the theorem of the addition of velocities,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,in one direction in the form which also results from the hypotheses of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,classical mechanics- This theorem can also be deduced readily horn the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Galilei transformation (Section 11). In place of the man walking,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"inside the carriage, we introduce a point moving relatively to the","Einstein, Albert"

5001,By means of the first and fourth equations of the Galilei,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,which corresponds to the theorem of addition for velocities in one,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,direction according to the theory of relativity. The question now,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,arises as to which of these two theorems is the better in accord with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,experience. On this point we axe enlightened by a most important,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,experiment which the brilliant physicist Fizeau performed more than,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"half a century ago, and which has been repeated since then by some of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the best experimental physicists, so that there can be no doubt about","Einstein, Albert"
5001,its result. The experiment is concerned with the following question.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Light travels in a motionless liquid with a particular velocity w. How,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,quickly does it travel in the direction of the arrow in the tube T,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"(see the accompanying diagram, Fig. 3) when the liquid above","Einstein, Albert"
5001,mentioned is flowing through the tube with a velocity v ?,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,In accordance with the principle of relativity we shall certainly have,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,to take for granted that the propagation of light always takes place,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"with the same velocity w with respect to the liquid, whether the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,latter is in motion with reference to other bodies or not. The,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,velocity of light relative to the liquid and the velocity of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"latter relative to the tube are thus known, and we require the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,velocity of light relative to the tube.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,It is clear that we have the problem of Section 6 again before us. The,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,tube plays the part of the railway embankment or of the co-ordinate,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,Galilei transformation or the Lorentz transformation corresponds to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the facts. Experiment * decides in favour of equation (B) derived,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"from the theory of relativity, and the agreement is, indeed, very","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"exact. According to recent and most excellent measurements by Zeeman,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the influence of the velocity of flow v on the propagation of light is,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,represented by formula (B) to within one per cent.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Nevertheless we must now draw attention to the fact that a theory of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,this phenomenon was given by H. A. Lorentz long before the statement,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of the theory of relativity. This theory was of a purely,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"electrodynamical nature, and was obtained by the use of particular","Einstein, Albert"
5001,hypotheses as to the electromagnetic structure of matter. This,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"circumstance, however, does not in the least diminish the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,conclusiveness of the experiment as a crucial test in favour of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"theory of relativity, for the electrodynamics of Maxwell-Lorentz, on","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"which the original theory was based, in no way opposes the theory of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,relativity. Rather has the latter been developed trom electrodynamics,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,as an astoundingly simple combination and generalisation of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"hypotheses, formerly independent of each other, on which","Einstein, Albert"

5001,THE HEURISTIC VALUE OF THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Our train of thought in the foregoing pages can be epitomised in the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"following manner. Experience has led to the conviction that, on the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"one hand, the principle of relativity holds true and that on the other","Einstein, Albert"
5001,hand the velocity of transmission of light in vacuo has to be,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,considered equal to a constant c. By uniting these two postulates we,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"obtained the law of transformation for the rectangular co-ordinates x,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"y, z and the time t of the events which constitute the processes of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,nature. In this connection we did not obtain the Galilei,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"transformation, but, differing from classical mechanics, the Lorentz","Einstein, Albert"
5001,transformation.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"The law of transmission of light, the acceptance of which is justified","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"by our actual knowledge, played an important part in this process of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"thought. Once in possession of the Lorentz transformation, however, we","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"can combine this with the principle of relativity, and sum up the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,theory thus:,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Every general law of nature must be so constituted that it is,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"transformed into a law of exactly the same form when, instead of the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"space-time variables x, y, z, t of the original coordinate system K,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"we introduce new space-time variables x1, y1, z1, t1 of a co-ordinate","Einstein, Albert"
5001,system K1. In this connection the relation between the ordinary and,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the accented magnitudes is given by the Lorentz transformation. Or in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,brief : General laws of nature are co-variant with respect to Lorentz,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,transformations.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,This is a definite mathematical condition that the theory of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"relativity demands of a natural law, and in virtue of this, the theory","Einstein, Albert"
5001,becomes a valuable heuristic aid in the search for general laws of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,nature. If a general law of nature were to be found which did not,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"satisfy this condition, then at least one of the two fundamental","Einstein, Albert"
5001,assumptions of the theory would have been disproved. Let us now,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,GENERAL RESULTS OF THE THEORY,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,It is clear from our previous considerations that the (special) theory,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of relativity has grown out of electrodynamics and optics. In these,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"fields it has not appreciably altered the predictions of theory, but","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"it has considerably simplified the theoretical structure, i.e. the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"derivation of laws, and -- what is incomparably more important -- it","Einstein, Albert"
5001,has considerably reduced the number of independent hypothese forming,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the basis of theory. The special theory of relativity has rendered the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Maxwell-Lorentz theory so plausible, that the latter would have been","Einstein, Albert"
5001,generally accepted by physicists even if experiment had decided less,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,unequivocally in its favour.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Classical mechanics required to be modified before it could come into,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,line with the demands of the special theory of relativity. For the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"main part, however, this modification affects only the laws for rapid","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"motions, in which the velocities of matter v are not very small as","Einstein, Albert"
5001,compared with the velocity of light. We have experience of such rapid,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,motions only in the case of electrons and ions; for other motions the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,variations from the laws of classical mechanics are too small to make,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,themselves evident in practice. We shall not consider the motion of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,stars until we come to speak of the general theory of relativity. In,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,accordance with the theory of relativity the kinetic energy of a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,material point of mass m is no longer given by the well-known,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,expression,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,This expression approaches infinity as the velocity v approaches the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,velocity of light c. The velocity must therefore always remain less,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"than c, however great may be the energies used to produce the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,acceleration. If we develop the expression for the kinetic energy in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the form of a series, we obtain","Einstein, Albert"

5001,"always small in comparison with the second,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,which last is alone considered in classical mechanics. The first term,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"mc^2 does not contain the velocity, and requires no consideration if","Einstein, Albert"
5001,we are only dealing with the question as to how the energy of a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,point-mass; depends on the velocity. We shall speak of its essential,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,significance later.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,The most important result of a general character to which the special,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,theory of relativity has led is concerned with the conception of mass.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Before the advent of relativity, physics recognised two conservation","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"laws of fundamental importance, namely, the law of the canservation of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,energy and the law of the conservation of mass these two fundamental,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,laws appeared to be quite independent of each other. By means of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,theory of relativity they have been united into one law. We shall now,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"briefly consider how this unification came about, and what meaning is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,to be attached to it.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,The principle of relativity requires that the law of the concervation,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of energy should hold not only with reference to a co-ordinate system,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"K, but also with respect to every co-ordinate system K1 which is in a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"state of uniform motion of translation relative to K, or, briefly,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"relative to every "" Galileian "" system of co-ordinates. In contrast to","Einstein, Albert"

5001,in the transition from one such system to another.,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,By means of comparatively simple considerations we are led to draw the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"following conclusion from these premises, in conjunction with the","Einstein, Albert"

5001,"with the velocity v, which absorbs * an amount of energy E[0] in","Einstein, Albert"

5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the inertial mass of a body is not a constant but varies according to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the change in the energy of the body. The inertial mass of a system of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,bodies can even be regarded as a measure of its energy. The law of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,conservation of the mass of a system becomes identical with the law of,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Let me add a final remark of a fundamental nature. The success of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Faraday-Maxwell interpretation of electromagnetic action at a distance,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,resulted in physicists becoming convinced that there are no such,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,things as instantaneous actions at a distance (not involving an,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,intermediary medium) of the type of Newton's law of gravitation.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"According to the theory of relativity, action at a distance with the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,velocity of light always takes the place of instantaneous action at a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,distance or of action at a distance with an infinite velocity of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,transmission. This is connected with the fact that the velocity c,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,plays a fundamental role in this theory. In Part II we shall see in,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,already mentioned in connection with the fundamental experiment of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Fizeau. The special theory of relativity has crystallised out from the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Maxwell-Lorentz theory of electromagnetic phenomena. Thus all facts of,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,"theory of relativity. As being of particular importance, I mention","Einstein, Albert"
5001,here the fact that the theory of relativity enables us to predict the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,effects produced on the light reaching us from the fixed stars. These,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"results are obtained in an exceedingly simple manner, and the effects","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"indicated, which are due to the relative motion of the earth with","Einstein, Albert"
5001,reference to those fixed stars are found to be in accord with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,experience. We refer to the yearly movement of the apparent position,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of the fixed stars resulting from the motion of the earth round the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"sun (aberration), and to the influence of the radial components of the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,relative motions of the fixed stars with respect to the earth on the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,colour of the light reaching us from them. The latter effect manifests,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,itself in a slight displacement of the spectral lines of the light,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"transmitted to us from a fixed star, as compared with the position of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the same spectral lines when they are produced by a terrestrial source,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of light (Doppler principle). The experimental arguments in favour of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the Maxwell-Lorentz theory, which are at the same time arguments in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"favour of the theory of relativity, are too numerous to be set forth","Einstein, Albert"
5001,here. In reality they limit the theoretical possibilities to such an,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"extent, that no other theory than that of Maxwell and Lorentz has been","Einstein, Albert"
5001,able to hold its own when tested by experience.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,But there are two classes of experimental facts hitherto obtained,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,which can be represented in the Maxwell-Lorentz theory only by the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"introduction of an auxiliary hypothesis, which in itself -- i.e.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,without making use of the theory of relativity -- appears extraneous.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,It is known that cathode rays and the so-called b-rays emitted by,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,radioactive substances consist of negatively electrified particles,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,(electrons) of very small inertia and large velocity. By examining the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,deflection of these rays under the influence of electric and magnetic,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"fields, we can study the law of motion of these particles very","Einstein, Albert"
5001,exactly.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"In the theoretical treatment of these electrons, we are faced with the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,difficulty that electrodynamic theory of itself is unable to give an,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,account of their nature. For since electrical masses of one sign repel,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"each other, the negative electrical masses constituting the electron","Einstein, Albert"
5001,would necessarily be scattered under the influence of their mutual,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"repulsions, unless there are forces of another kind operating between","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"them, the nature of which has hitherto remained obscure to us.*   If","Einstein, Albert"
5001,we now assume that the relative distances between the electrical,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,masses constituting the electron remain unchanged during the motion of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the electron (rigid connection in the sense of classical mechanics),","Einstein, Albert"
5001,we arrive at a law of motion of the electron which does not agree with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"experience. Guided by purely formal points of view, H. A. Lorentz was","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the first to introduce the hypothesis that the form of the electron,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,experiences a contraction in the direction of motion in consequence of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,that motion. the contracted length being proportional to the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,expression,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,                        eq. 05: file eq05.gif,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"This, hypothesis, which is not justifiable by any electrodynamical","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"facts, supplies us then with that particular law of motion which has","Einstein, Albert"
5001,been confirmed with great precision in recent years.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"The theory of relativity leads to the same law of motion, without","Einstein, Albert"
5001,requiring any special hypothesis whatsoever as to the structure and,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the behaviour of the electron. We arrived at a similar conclusion in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Section 13 in connection with the experiment of Fizeau, the result","Einstein, Albert"
5001,of which is foretold by the theory of relativity without the necessity,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of drawing on hypotheses as to the physical nature of the liquid.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,The second class of facts to which we have alluded has reference to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the question whether or not the motion of the earth in space can be,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,made perceptible in terrestrial experiments. We have already remarked,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,in Section 5 that all attempts of this nature led to a negative,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"result. Before the theory of relativity was put forward, it was","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"difficult to become reconciled to this negative result, for reasons","Einstein, Albert"
5001,now to be discussed. The inherited prejudices about time and space did,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,not allow any doubt to arise as to the prime importance of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Galileian transformation for changing over from one body of reference,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,to another. Now assuming that the Maxwell-Lorentz equations hold for a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"reference-body K, we then find that they do not hold for a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"reference-body K1 moving uniformly with respect to K, if we assume","Einstein, Albert"
5001,that the relations of the Galileian transformstion exist between the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"co-ordinates of K and K1. It thus appears that, of all Galileian","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"co-ordinate systems, one (K) corresponding to a particular state of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,motion is physically unique. This result was interpreted physically by,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,regarding K as at rest with respect to a hypothetical ther of space.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"On the other hand, all coordinate systems K1 moving relatively to K","Einstein, Albert"
5001,were to be regarded as in motion with respect to the ther. To this,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"motion of K1 against the ther (""ther-drift "" relative to K1) were","Einstein, Albert"
5001,attributed the more complicated laws which were supposed to hold,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"relative to K1. Strictly speaking, such an ther-drift ought also to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"be assumed relative to the earth, and for a long time the efforts of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,physicists were devoted to attempts to detect the existence of an,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,ther-drift at the earth's surface.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,In one of the most notable of these attempts Michelson devised a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,method which appears as though it must be decisive. Imagine two,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,mirrors so arranged on a rigid body that the reflecting surfaces face,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,each other. A ray of light requires a perfectly definite time T to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"pass from one mirror to the other and back again, if the whole system","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"be at rest with respect to the ther. It is found by calculation,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"however, that a slightly different time T1 is required for this","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"process, if the body, together with the mirrors, be moving relatively","Einstein, Albert"
5001,to the ther. And yet another point: it is shown by calculation that,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"for a given velocity v with reference to the ther, this time T1 is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,different when the body is moving perpendicularly to the planes of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,mirrors from that resulting when the motion is parallel to these,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,planes. Although the estimated difference between these two times is,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"exceedingly small, Michelson and Morley performed an experiment","Einstein, Albert"
5001,involving interference in which this difference should have been,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,clearly detectable. But the experiment gave a negative result -- a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,fact very perplexing to physicists. Lorentz and FitzGerald rescued the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,theory from this difficulty by assuming that the motion of the body,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,relative to the ther produces a contraction of the body in the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"direction of motion, the amount of contraction being just sufficient","Einstein, Albert"
5001,to compensate for the differeace in time mentioned above. Comparison,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,with the discussion in Section 11 shows that also from the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,standpoint of the theory of relativity this solution of the difficulty,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,was the right one. But on the basis of the theory of relativity the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,method of interpretation is incomparably more satisfactory. According,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"to this theory there is no such thing as a "" specially favoured ""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,(unique) co-ordinate system to occasion the introduction of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"ther-idea, and hence there can be no ther-drift, nor any experiment","Einstein, Albert"
5001,with which to demonstrate it. Here the contraction of moving bodies,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"follows from the two fundamental principles of the theory, without the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,introduction of particular hypotheses ; and as the prime factor,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"involved in this contraction we find, not the motion in itself, to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"which we cannot attach any meaning, but the motion with respect to the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,body of reference chosen in the particular case in point. Thus for a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,co-ordinate system moving with the earth the mirror system of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Michelson and Morley is not shortened, but it is shortened for a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,co-ordinate system which is at rest relatively to the sun.,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,"Similarly, the world of physical phenomena which was briefly called ""","Einstein, Albert"

5001,That we have not been accustomed to regard the world in this sense as,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"a four-dimensional continuum is due to the fact that in physics,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"before the advent of the theory of relativity, time played a different","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"and more independent role, as compared with the space coordinates. It","Einstein, Albert"
5001,is for this reason that we have been in the habit of treating time as,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"an independent continuum. As a matter of fact, according to classical","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"mechanics, time is absolute, i.e. it is independent of the position","Einstein, Albert"
5001,and the condition of motion of the system of co-ordinates. We see this,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,be found rather in the fact of his recognition that the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"four-dimensional space-time continuum of the theory of relativity, in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"its most essential formal properties, shows a pronounced relationship","Einstein, Albert"
5001,to the three-dimensional continuum of Euclidean geometrical,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"space.*  In order to give due prominence to this relationship,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"however, we must replace the usual time co-ordinate t by an imaginary","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"magnitude eq. 25 proportional to it. Under these conditions, the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,natural laws satisfying the demands of the (special) theory of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"relativity assume mathematical forms, in which the time co-ordinate","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"plays exactly the same role as the three space co-ordinates. Formally,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,these four co-ordinates correspond exactly to the three space,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,SPECIAL AND GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"The basal principle, which was the pivot of all our previous","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"considerations, was the special principle of relativity, i.e. the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,principle of the physical relativity of all uniform motion. Let as,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,once more analyse its meaning carefully.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"It was at all times clear that, from the point of view of the idea it","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"conveys to us, every motion must be considered only as a relative","Einstein, Albert"
5001,motion. Returning to the illustration we have frequently used of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"embankment and the railway carriage, we can express the fact of the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"motion here taking place in the following two forms, both of which are","Einstein, Albert"
5001,equally justifiable :,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"(a) The carriage is in motion relative to the embankment,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,(b) The embankment is in motion relative to the carriage.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"In (a) the embankment, in (b) the carriage, serves as the body of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,reference in our statement of the motion taking place. If it is simply,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"a question of detecting or of describing the motion involved, it is in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,principle immaterial to what reference-body we refer the motion. As,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"already mentioned, this is self-evident, but it must not be confused","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"with the much more comprehensive statement called ""the principle of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"relativity,"" which we have taken as the basis of our investigations.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,The principle we have made use of not only maintains that we may,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,equally well choose the carriage or the embankment as our,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"reference-body for the description of any event (for this, too, is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,self-evident). Our principle rather asserts what follows : If we,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,formulate the general laws of nature as they are obtained from,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"experience, by making use of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"(a) the embankment as reference-body,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"(b) the railway carriage as reference-body,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,then these general laws of nature (e.g. the laws of mechanics or the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,law of the propagation of light in vacuo) have exactly the same form,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,in both cases. This can also be expressed as follows : For the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"physical description of natural processes, neither of the reference","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"bodies K, K1 is unique (lit. "" specially marked out "") as compared","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"with the other. Unlike the first, this latter statement need not of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"necessity hold a priori; it is not contained in the conceptions of ""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"motion"" and "" reference-body "" and derivable from them; only","Einstein, Albert"
5001,experience can decide as to its correctness or incorrectness.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Up to the present, however, we have by no means maintained the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,equivalence of all bodies of reference K in connection with the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,formulation of natural laws. Our course was more on the following,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Iines. In the first place, we started out from the assumption that","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"there exists a reference-body K, whose condition of motion is such","Einstein, Albert"
5001,that the Galileian law holds with respect to it : A particle left to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,itself and sufficiently far removed from all other particles moves,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,uniformly in a straight line. With reference to K (Galileian,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,reference-body) the laws of nature were to be as simple as possible.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"But in addition to K, all bodies of reference K1 should be given","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"preference in this sense, and they should be exactly equivalent to K","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"for the formulation of natural laws, provided that they are in a state","Einstein, Albert"
5001,of uniform rectilinear and non-rotary motion with respect to K ; all,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,these bodies of reference are to be regarded as Galileian,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,reference-bodies. The validity of the principle of relativity was,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"assumed only for these reference-bodies, but not for others (e.g.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,those possessing motion of a different kind). In this sense we speak,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of the special principle of relativity, or special theory of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,relativity.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"In contrast to this we wish to understand by the ""general principle of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"relativity"" the following statement : All bodies of reference K, K1,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"etc., are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"(formulation of the general laws of nature), whatever may be their","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"state of motion. But before proceeding farther, it ought to be pointed","Einstein, Albert"
5001,out that this formulation must be replaced later by a more abstract,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"one, for reasons which will become evident at a later stage.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Since the introduction of the special principle of relativity has been,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"justified, every intellect which strives after generalisation must","Einstein, Albert"
5001,feel the temptation to venture the step towards the general principle,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of relativity. But a simple and apparently quite reliable,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"consideration seems to suggest that, for the present at any rate,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,there is little hope of success in such an attempt; Let us imagine,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"ourselves transferred to our old friend the railway carriage, which is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"travelling at a uniform rate. As long as it is moving unifromly, the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"occupant of the carriage is not sensible of its motion, and it is for","Einstein, Albert"
5001,this reason that he can without reluctance interpret the facts of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"case as indicating that the carriage is at rest, but the embankment in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"motion. Moreover, according to the special principle of relativity,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,this interpretation is quite justified also from a physical point of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,view.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,If the motion of the carriage is now changed into a non-uniform,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"motion, as for instance by a powerful application of the brakes, then","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the occupant of the carriage experiences a correspondingly powerful,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,jerk forwards. The retarded motion is manifested in the mechanical,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,behaviour of bodies relative to the person in the railway carriage.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,The mechanical behaviour is different from that of the case previously,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"considered, and for this reason it would appear to be impossible that","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the same mechanical laws hold relatively to the non-uniformly moving,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"carriage, as hold with reference to the carriage when at rest or in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,uniform motion. At all events it is clear that the Galileian law does,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,not hold with respect to the non-uniformly moving carriage. Because of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"this, we feel compelled at the present juncture to grant a kind of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"absolute physical reality to non-uniform motion, in opposition to the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,general principle of relatvity. But in what follows we shall soon see,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,"""If we pick up a stone and then let it go, why does it fall to the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"ground ?"" The usual answer to this question is: ""Because it is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"attracted by the earth."" Modern physics formulates the answer rather","Einstein, Albert"
5001,differently for the following reason. As a result of the more careful,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"study of electromagnetic phenomena, we have come to regard action at a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,distance as a process impossible without the intervention of some,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"intermediary medium. If, for instance, a magnet attracts a piece of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"iron, we cannot be content to regard this as meaning that the magnet","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"acts directly on the iron through the intermediate empty space, but we","Einstein, Albert"
5001,are constrained to imagine -- after the manner of Faraday -- that the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,magnet always calls into being something physically real in the space,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"around it, that something being what we call a ""magnetic field."" In","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"its turn this magnetic field operates on the piece of iron, so that","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the latter strives to move towards the magnet. We shall not discuss,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"here the justification for this incidental conception, which is indeed","Einstein, Albert"
5001,a somewhat arbitrary one. We shall only mention that with its aid,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,electromagnetic phenomena can be theoretically represented much more,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"satisfactorily than without it, and this applies particularly to the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,transmission of electromagnetic waves. The effects of gravitation also,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,are regarded in an analogous manner.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,The action of the earth on the stone takes place indirectly. The earth,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"produces in its surrounding a gravitational field, which acts on the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"stone and produces its motion of fall. As we know from experience, the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,intensity of the action on a body dimishes according to a quite,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"definite law, as we proceed farther and farther away from the earth.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,From our point of view this means : The law governing the properties,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of the gravitational field in space must be a perfectly definite one,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,in order correctly to represent the diminution of gravitational action,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,with the distance from operative bodies. It is something like this:,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,The body (e.g. the earth) produces a field in its immediate,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,neighbourhood directly; the intensity and direction of the field at,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,points farther removed from the body are thence determined by the law,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,which governs the properties in space of the gravitational fields,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,themselves.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"In contrast to electric and magnetic fields, the gravitational field","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"exhibits a most remarkable property, which is of fundamental","Einstein, Albert"
5001,importance for what follows. Bodies which are moving under the sole,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"influence of a gravitational field receive an acceleration, which does","Einstein, Albert"
5001,not in the least depend either on the material or on the physical,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"state of the body. For instance, a piece of lead and a piece of wood","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"fall in exactly the same manner in a gravitational field (in vacuo),","Einstein, Albert"
5001,when they start off from rest or with the same initial velocity. This,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"law, which holds most accurately, can be expressed in a different form","Einstein, Albert"
5001,in the light of the following consideration.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"According to Newton's law of motion, we have","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"(Force) = (inertial mass) x (acceleration),","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"where the ""inertial mass"" is a characteristic constant of the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"accelerated body. If now gravitation is the cause of the acceleration,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,we then have,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,(Force) = (gravitational mass) x (intensity of the gravitational,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"field),","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"where the ""gravitational mass"" is likewise a characteristic constant","Einstein, Albert"
5001,for the body. From these two relations follows:,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,                                eq. 26: file eq26.gif,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"If now, as we find from experience, the acceleration is to be","Einstein, Albert"
5001,independent of the nature and the condition of the body and always the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"same for a given gravitational field, then the ratio of the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,gravitational to the inertial mass must likewise be the same for all,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,bodies. By a suitable choice of units we can thus make this ratio,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,equal to unity. We then have the following law: The gravitational mass,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of a body is equal to its inertial law.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,It is true that this important law had hitherto been recorded in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"mechanics, but it had not been interpreted. A satisfactory","Einstein, Albert"
5001,interpretation can be obtained only if we recognise the following fact,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,: The same quality of a body manifests itself according to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"circumstances as "" inertia "" or as "" weight "" (lit. "" heaviness '). In","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the following section we shall show to what extent this is actually,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the case, and how this question is connected with the general","Einstein, Albert"
5001,postulate of relativity.,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,THE EQUALITY OF INERTIAL AND GRAVITATIONAL MASS,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,AS AN ARGUMENT FOR THE GENERAL POSTULE OF RELATIVITY,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"We imagine a large portion of empty space, so far removed from stars","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"and other appreciable masses, that we have before us approximately the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,conditions required by the fundamental law of Galilei. It is then,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,possible to choose a Galileian reference-body for this part of space,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"(world), relative to which points at rest remain at rest and points in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,motion continue permanently in uniform rectilinear motion. As,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,reference-body let us imagine a spacious chest resembling a room with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,an observer inside who is equipped with apparatus. Gravitation,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,naturally does not exist for this observer. He must fasten himself,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"with strings to the floor, otherwise the slightest impact against the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,floor will cause him to rise slowly towards the ceiling of the room.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,To the middle of the lid of the chest is fixed externally a hook with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"rope attached, and now a "" being "" (what kind of a being is immaterial","Einstein, Albert"
5001,to us) begins pulling at this with a constant force. The chest,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"together with the observer then begin to move ""upwards"" with a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,uniformly accelerated motion. In course of time their velocity will,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,reach unheard-of values -- provided that we are viewing all this from,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,another reference-body which is not being pulled with a rope.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,But how does the man in the chest regard the Process ? The,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,acceleration of the chest will be transmitted to him by the reaction,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of the floor of the chest. He must therefore take up this pressure by,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,means of his legs if he does not wish to be laid out full length on,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the floor. He is then standing in the chest in exactly the same way as,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,anyone stands in a room of a home on our earth. If he releases a body,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"which he previously had in his land, the accelertion of the chest will","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"no longer be transmitted to this body, and for this reason the body","Einstein, Albert"
5001,will approach the floor of the chest with an accelerated relative,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,motion. The observer will further convince himself that the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,acceleration of the body towards the floor of the chest is always of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the same magnitude, whatever kind of body he may happen to use for the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,experiment.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Relying on his knowledge of the gravitational field (as it was,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"discussed in the preceding section), the man in the chest will thus","Einstein, Albert"
5001,come to the conclusion that he and the chest are in a gravitational,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,field which is constant with regard to time. Of course he will be,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,puzzled for a moment as to why the chest does not fall in this,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"gravitational field. just then, however, he discovers the hook in the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"middle of the lid of the chest and the rope which is attached to it,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,and he consequently comes to the conclusion that the chest is,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,suspended at rest in the gravitational field.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Ought we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion ?,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,I do not believe we ought to if we wish to remain consistent ; we must,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,rather admit that his mode of grasping the situation violates neither,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,reason nor known mechanical laws. Even though it is being accelerated,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"with respect to the ""Galileian space"" first considered, we can","Einstein, Albert"
5001,nevertheless regard the chest as being at rest. We have thus good,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,grounds for extending the principle of relativity to include bodies of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"reference which are accelerated with respect to each other, and as a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,result we have gained a powerful argument for a generalised postulate,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of relativity.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,We must note carefully that the possibility of this mode of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,interpretation rests on the fundamental property of the gravitational,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"field of giving all bodies the same acceleration, or, what comes to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the same thing, on the law of the equality of inertial and","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"gravitational mass. If this natural law did not exist, the man in the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,accelerated chest would not be able to interpret the behaviour of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"bodies around him on the supposition of a gravitational field, and he","Einstein, Albert"
5001,would not be justified on the grounds of experience in supposing his,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"reference-body to be "" at rest.""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Suppose that the man in the chest fixes a rope to the inner side of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the lid, and that he attaches a body to the free end of the rope. The","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"result of this will be to strech the rope so that it will hang ""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"vertically "" downwards. If we ask for an opinion of the cause of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"tension in the rope, the man in the chest will say: ""The suspended","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"body experiences a downward force in the gravitational field, and this","Einstein, Albert"
5001,is neutralised by the tension of the rope ; what determines the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,magnitude of the tension of the rope is the gravitational mass of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"suspended body."" On the other hand, an observer who is poised freely","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"in space will interpret the condition of things thus : "" The rope must","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"perforce take part in the accelerated motion of the chest, and it","Einstein, Albert"
5001,transmits this motion to the body attached to it. The tension of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,rope is just large enough to effect the acceleration of the body. That,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,which determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"inertial mass of the body."" Guided by this example, we see that our","Einstein, Albert"
5001,extension of the principle of relativity implies the necessity of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass. Thus we have,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,obtained a physical interpretation of this law.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,From our consideration of the accelerated chest we see that a general,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,theory of relativity must yield important results on the laws of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"gravitation. In point of fact, the systematic pursuit of the general","Einstein, Albert"
5001,idea of relativity has supplied the laws satisfied by the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"gravitational field. Before proceeding farther, however, I must warn","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the reader against a misconception suggested by these considerations.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"A gravitational field exists for the man in the chest, despite the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,fact that there was no such field for the co-ordinate system first,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,chosen. Now we might easily suppose that the existence of a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,gravitational field is always only an apparent one. We might also,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"think that, regardless of the kind of gravitational field which may be","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"present, we could always choose another reference-body such that no","Einstein, Albert"
5001,gravitational field exists with reference to it. This is by no means,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"true for all gravitational fields, but only for those of quite special","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"form. It is, for instance, impossible to choose a body of reference","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"such that, as judged from it, the gravitational field of the earth (in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,its entirety) vanishes.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"We can now appreciate why that argument is not convincing, which we","Einstein, Albert"
5001,brought forward against the general principle of relativity at theend,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of Section 18. It is certainly true that the observer in the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,railway carriage experiences a jerk forwards as a result of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"application of the brake, and that he recognises, in this the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,non-uniformity of motion (retardation) of the carriage. But he is,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"compelled by nobody to refer this jerk to a "" real "" acceleration","Einstein, Albert"
5001,(retardation) of the carriage. He might also interpret his experience,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"thus: "" My body of reference (the carriage) remains permanently at","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"rest. With reference to it, however, there exists (during the period","Einstein, Albert"
5001,of application of the brakes) a gravitational field which is directed,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,forwards and which is variable with respect to time. Under the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"influence of this field, the embankment together with the earth moves","Einstein, Albert"
5001,non-uniformly in such a manner that their original velocity in the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"backwards direction is continuously reduced.""","Einstein, Albert"

5001,IN WHAT RESPECTS ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND OF THE,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY UNSATISFACTORY?,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,We have already stated several times that classical mechanics starts,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,out from the following law: Material particles sufficiently far,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,removed from other material particles continue to move uniformly in a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,straight line or continue in a state of rest. We have also repeatedly,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,emphasised that this fundamental law can only be valid for bodies of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"reference K which possess certain unique states of motion, and which","Einstein, Albert"
5001,are in uniform translational motion relative to each other. Relative,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,to other reference-bodies K the law is not valid. Both in classical,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,mechanics and in the special theory of relativity we therefore,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,differentiate between reference-bodies K relative to which the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"recognised "" laws of nature "" can be said to hold, and","Einstein, Albert"
5001,reference-bodies K relative to which these laws do not hold.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,But no person whose mode of thought is logical can rest satisfied with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"this condition of things. He asks : "" How does it come that certain","Einstein, Albert"
5001,reference-bodies (or their states of motion) are given priority over,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,other reference-bodies (or their states of motion) ? What is the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,reason for this Preference? In order to show clearly what I mean by,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"this question, I shall make use of a comparison.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,I am standing in front of a gas range. Standing alongside of each,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,other on the range are two pans so much alike that one may be mistaken,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,for the other. Both are half full of water. I notice that steam is,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"being emitted continuously from the one pan, but not from the other. I","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"am surprised at this, even if I have never seen either a gas range or","Einstein, Albert"
5001,a pan before. But if I now notice a luminous something of bluish,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"colour under the first pan but not under the other, I cease to be","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"astonished, even if I have never before seen a gas flame. For I can","Einstein, Albert"
5001,only say that this bluish something will cause the emission of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"steam, or at least possibly it may do so. If, however, I notice the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"bluish something in neither case, and if I observe that the one","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"continuously emits steam whilst the other does not, then I shall","Einstein, Albert"
5001,remain astonished and dissatisfied until I have discovered some,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,circumstance to which I can attribute the different behaviour of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,two pans.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Analogously, I seek in vain for a real something in classical","Einstein, Albert"
5001,mechanics (or in the special theory of relativity) to which I can,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,attribute the different behaviour of bodies considered with respect to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the reference systems K and K1.*  Newton saw this objection and,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"attempted to invalidate it, but without success. But E. Mach recognsed","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"it most clearly of all, and because of this objection he claimed that","Einstein, Albert"
5001,mechanics must be placed on a new basis. It can only be got rid of by,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,means of a physics which is conformable to the general principle of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"relativity, since the equations of such a theory hold for every body","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of reference, whatever may be its state of motion.","Einstein, Albert"

5001,A FEW INFERENCES FROM THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,The considerations of Section 20 show that the general principle of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,relativity puts us in a position to derive properties of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"gravitational field in a purely theoretical manner. Let us suppose,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"for instance, that we know the space-time "" course "" for any natural","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"process whatsoever, as regards the manner in which it takes place in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the Galileian domain relative to a Galileian body of reference K. By,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,means of purely theoretical operations (i.e. simply by calculation) we,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"are then able to find how this known natural process appears, as seen","Einstein, Albert"
5001,from a reference-body K1 which is accelerated relatively to K. But,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,since a gravitational field exists with respect to this new body of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"reference K1, our consideration also teaches us how the gravitational","Einstein, Albert"
5001,field influences the process studied.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"For example, we learn that a body which is in a state of uniform","Einstein, Albert"
5001,rectilinear motion with respect to K (in accordance with the law of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Galilei) is executing an accelerated and in general curvilinear motion,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,with respect to the accelerated reference-body K1 (chest). This,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,acceleration or curvature corresponds to the influence on the moving,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,body of the gravitational field prevailing relatively to K. It is,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,known that a gravitational field influences the movement of bodies in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"this way, so that our consideration supplies us with nothing","Einstein, Albert"
5001,essentially new.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"However, we obtain a new result of fundamental importance when we","Einstein, Albert"
5001,carry out the analogous consideration for a ray of light. With respect,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"to the Galileian reference-body K, such a ray of light is transmitted","Einstein, Albert"
5001,rectilinearly with the velocity c. It can easily be shown that the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,path of the same ray of light is no longer a straight line when we,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,consider it with reference to the accelerated chest (reference-body,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"K1). From this we conclude, that, in general, rays of light are","Einstein, Albert"
5001,propagated curvilinearly in gravitational fields. In two respects this,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,result is of great importance.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"In the first place, it can be compared with the reality. Although a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,detailed examination of the question shows that the curvature of light,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,rays required by the general theory of relativity is only exceedingly,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"small for the gravitational fields at our disposal in practice, its","Einstein, Albert"
5001,estimated magnitude for light rays passing the sun at grazing,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,incidence is nevertheless 1.7 seconds of arc. This ought to manifest,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"itself in the following way. As seen from the earth, certain fixed","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"stars appear to be in the neighbourhood of the sun, and are thus","Einstein, Albert"
5001,capable of observation during a total eclipse of the sun. At such,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"times, these stars ought to appear to be displaced outwards from the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"sun by an amount indicated above, as compared with their apparent","Einstein, Albert"
5001,position in the sky when the sun is situated at another part of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,heavens. The examination of the correctness or otherwise of this,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"deduction is a problem of the greatest importance, the early solution","Einstein, Albert"
5001,of which is to be expected of astronomers.[2]*,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"In the second place our result shows that, according to the general","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"theory of relativity, the law of the constancy of the velocity of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"light in vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fundamental","Einstein, Albert"
5001,assumptions in the special theory of relativity and to which we have,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"already frequently referred, cannot claim any unlimited validity. A","Einstein, Albert"
5001,curvature of rays of light can only take place when the velocity of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,propagation of light varies with position. Now we might think that as,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"a consequence of this, the special theory of relativity and with it","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the whole theory of relativity would be laid in the dust. But in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,reality this is not the case. We can only conclude that the special,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,theory of relativity cannot claim an unlinlited domain of validity ;,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,its results hold only so long as we are able to disregard the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,influences of gravitational fields on the phenomena (e.g. of light).,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Since it has often been contended by opponents of the theory of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,relativity that the special theory of relativity is overthrown by the,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,Before the development of electrodynamics the laws of electrostatics,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,were looked upon as the laws of electricity. At the present time we,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,know that electric fields can be derived correctly from electrostatic,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"considerations only for the case, which is never strictly realised, in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,which the electrical masses are quite at rest relatively to each,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"other, and to the co-ordinate system. Should we be justified in saying","Einstein, Albert"
5001,that for this reason electrostatics is overthrown by the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,field-equations of Maxwell in electrodynamics ? Not in the least.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Electrostatics is contained in electrodynamics as a limiting case ;,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the laws of the latter lead directly to those of the former for the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,case in which the fields are invariable with regard to time. No fairer,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"destiny could be allotted to any physical theory, than that it should","Einstein, Albert"
5001,of itself point out the way to the introduction of a more,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"comprehensive theory, in which it lives on as a limiting case.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"In the example of the transmission of light just dealt with, we have","Einstein, Albert"
5001,seen that the general theory of relativity enables us to derive,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,theoretically the influence of a gravitational field on the course of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"natural processes, the Iaws of which are already known when a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"gravitational field is absent. But the most attractive problem, to the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"solution of which the general theory of relativity supplies the key,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,concerns the investigation of the laws satisfied by the gravitational,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,field itself. Let us consider this for a moment.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,We are acquainted with space-time domains which behave (approximately),"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"in a "" Galileian "" fashion under suitable choice of reference-body,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,i.e. domains in which gravitational fields are absent. If we now refer,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"such a domain to a reference-body K1 possessing any kind of motion,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,then relative to K1 there exists a gravitational field which is,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,variable with respect to space and time.[3]**  The character of this,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,field will of course depend on the motion chosen for K1. According to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the general theory of relativity, the general law of the gravitational","Einstein, Albert"
5001,field must be satisfied for all gravitational fields obtainable in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,this way. Even though by no means all gravitationial fields can be,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"produced in this way, yet we may entertain the hope that the general","Einstein, Albert"
5001,law of gravitation will be derivable from such gravitational fields of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,a special kind. This hope has been realised in the most beautiful,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,manner. But between the clear vision of this goal and its actual,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"realisation it was necessary to surmount a serious difficulty, and as","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"this lies deep at the root of things, I dare not withhold it from the","Einstein, Albert"

5001,"slovenliness of treatment, which, as we know from the special theory","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of relativity, is far from being unimportant and pardonable. It is now","Einstein, Albert"
5001,high time that we remedy this defect; but I would mention at the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"outset, that this matter lays no small claims on the patience and on","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the power of abstraction of the reader.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"We start off again from quite special cases, which we have frequently","Einstein, Albert"
5001,used before. Let us consider a space time domain in which no,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,gravitational field exists relative to a reference-body K whose state,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of motion has been suitably chosen. K is then a Galileian,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"reference-body as regards the domain considered, and the results of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the special theory of relativity hold relative to K. Let us supposse,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the same domain referred to a second body of reference K1, which is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"rotating uniformly with respect to K. In order to fix our ideas, we","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"shall imagine K1 to be in the form of a plane circular disc, which","Einstein, Albert"
5001,rotates uniformly in its own plane about its centre. An observer who,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,is sitting eccentrically on the disc K1 is sensible of a force which,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"acts outwards in a radial direction, and which would be interpreted as","Einstein, Albert"
5001,an effect of inertia (centrifugal force) by an observer who was at,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,rest with respect to the original reference-body K. But the observer,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"on the disc may regard his disc as a reference-body which is "" at rest","Einstein, Albert"
5001,""" ; on the basis of the general principle of relativity he is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"justified in doing this. The force acting on himself, and in fact on","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"all other bodies which are at rest relative to the disc, he regards as","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the effect of a gravitational field. Nevertheless, the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,space-distribution of this gravitational field is of a kind that would,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,not be possible on Newton's theory of gravitation.* But since the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"observer believes in the general theory of relativity, this does not","Einstein, Albert"
5001,disturb him; he is quite in the right when he believes that a general,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,law of gravitation can be formulated- a law which not only explains,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the motion of the stars correctly, but also the field of force","Einstein, Albert"
5001,experienced by himself.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,The observer performs experiments on his circular disc with clocks and,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"measuring-rods. In doing so, it is his intention to arrive at exact","Einstein, Albert"
5001,definitions for the signification of time- and space-data with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"reference to the circular disc K1, these definitions being based on","Einstein, Albert"
5001,his observations. What will be his experience in this enterprise ?,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"To start with, he places one of two identically constructed clocks at","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the centre of the circular disc, and the other on the edge of the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"disc, so that they are at rest relative to it. We now ask ourselves","Einstein, Albert"
5001,whether both clocks go at the same rate from the standpoint of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"non-rotating Galileian reference-body K. As judged from this body, the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"clock at the centre of the disc has no velocity, whereas the clock at","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the edge of the disc is in motion relative to K in consequence of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"rotation. According to a result obtained in Section 12, it follows","Einstein, Albert"
5001,that the latter clock goes at a rate permanently slower than that of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the clock at the centre of the circular disc, i.e. as observed from K.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,It is obvious that the same effect would be noted by an observer whom,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,we will imagine sitting alongside his clock at the centre of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"circular disc. Thus on our circular disc, or, to make the case more","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"general, in every gravitational field, a clock will go more quickly or","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"less quickly, according to the position in which the clock is situated","Einstein, Albert"
5001,(at rest). For this reason it is not possible to obtain a reasonable,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,definition of time with the aid of clocks which are arranged at rest,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,with respect to the body of reference. A similar difficulty presents,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,itself when we attempt to apply our earlier definition of simultaneity,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"in such a case, but I do not wish to go any farther into this","Einstein, Albert"
5001,question.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Moreover, at this stage the definition of the space co-ordinates also","Einstein, Albert"
5001,presents insurmountable difficulties. If the observer applies his,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,standard measuring-rod (a rod which is short as compared with the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"radius of the disc) tangentially to the edge of the disc, then, as","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"judged from the Galileian system, the length of this rod will be less","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"than I, since, according to Section 12, moving bodies suffer a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"shortening in the direction of the motion. On the other hand, the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"measaring-rod will not experience a shortening in length, as judged","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"from K, if it is applied to the disc in the direction of the radius.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"If, then, the observer first measures the circumference of the disc","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"with his measuring-rod and then the diameter of the disc, on dividing","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the one by the other, he will not obtain as quotient the familiar","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"number p = 3.14 . . ., but a larger number,[4]** whereas of course,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"for a disc which is at rest with respect to K, this operation would","Einstein, Albert"
5001,yield p exactly. This proves that the propositions of Euclidean,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"geometry cannot hold exactly on the rotating disc, nor in general in a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"gravitational field, at least if we attribute the length I to the rod","Einstein, Albert"
5001,in all positions and in every orientation. Hence the idea of a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,straight line also loses its meaning. We are therefore not in a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"position to define exactly the co-ordinates x, y, z relative to the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"disc by means of the method used in discussing the special theory, and","Einstein, Albert"
5001,as long as the co- ordinates and times of events have not been,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"defined, we cannot assign an exact meaning to the natural laws in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,which these occur.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Thus all our previous conclusions based on general relativity would,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,appear to be called in question. In reality we must make a subtle,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,detour in order to be able to apply the postulate of general,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,relativity exactly. I shall prepare the reader for this in the,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Let us now imagine that a large number of little rods of equal length,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"have been made, their lengths being small compared with the dimensions","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of the marble slab. When I say they are of equal length, I mean that","Einstein, Albert"
5001,one can be laid on any other without the ends overlapping. We next lay,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,four of these little rods on the marble slab so that they constitute a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"quadrilateral figure (a square), the diagonals of which are equally","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"long. To ensure the equality of the diagonals, we make use of a little","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"testing-rod. To this square we add similar ones, each of which has one","Einstein, Albert"
5001,rod in common with the first. We proceed in like manner with each of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,these squares until finally the whole marble slab is laid out with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"squares. The arrangement is such, that each side of a square belongs","Einstein, Albert"
5001,to two squares and each corner to four squares.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,It is a veritable wonder that we can carry out this business without,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,getting into the greatest difficulties. We only need to think of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"following. If at any moment three squares meet at a corner, then two","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"sides of the fourth square are already laid, and, as a consequence,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the arrangement of the remaining two sides of the square is already,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,completely determined. But I am now no longer able to adjust the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,quadrilateral so that its diagonals may be equal. If they are equal of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"their own accord, then this is an especial favour of the marble slab","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"and of the little rods, about which I can only be thankfully","Einstein, Albert"
5001,surprised. We must experience many such surprises if the construction,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,is to be successful.,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,By making use of the following modification of this abstract,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,"expand "" by in amount proportional to the increase of temperature. We","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"heat the central part of the marble slab, but not the periphery, in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,which case two of our little rods can still be brought into,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,coincidence at every position on the table. But our construction of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"squares must necessarily come into disorder during the heating,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"because the little rods on the central region of the table expand,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,whereas those on the outer part do not.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,With reference to our little rods -- defined as unit lengths -- the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"marble slab is no longer a Euclidean continuum, and we are also no","Einstein, Albert"
5001,longer in the position of defining Cartesian co-ordinates directly,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"with their aid, since the above construction can no longer be carried","Einstein, Albert"
5001,out. But since there are other things which are not influenced in a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,similar manner to the little rods (or perhaps not at all) by the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"temperature of the table, it is possible quite naturally to maintain","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the point of view that the marble slab is a "" Euclidean continuum.""","Einstein, Albert"

5001,the same way as regards the influence of temperature when they are on,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,detecting the effect of temperature than the geometrical behaviour of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"our rods in experiments analogous to the one described above, then our","Einstein, Albert"
5001,best plan would be to assign the distance one to two points on the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"slab, provided that the ends of one of our rods could be made to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,coincide with these two points ; for how else should we define the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,distance without our proceeding being in the highest measure grossly,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,arbitrary ? The method of Cartesian coordinates must then be,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"discarded, and replaced by another which does not assume the validity","Einstein, Albert"
5001,of Euclidean geometry for rigid bodies.*  The reader will notice,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,that the situation depicted here corresponds to the one brought about,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,*) Mathematicians have been confronted with our problem in the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,following form. If we are given a surface (e.g. an ellipsoid) in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Euclidean three-dimensional space, then there exists for this surface","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"a two-dimensional geometry, just as much as for a plane surface. Gauss","Einstein, Albert"
5001,undertook the task of treating this two-dimensional geometry from,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"first principles, without making use of the fact that the surface","Einstein, Albert"
5001,belongs to a Euclidean continuum of three dimensions. If we imagine,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,constructions to be made with rigid rods in the surface (similar to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"that above with the marble slab), we should find that different laws","Einstein, Albert"
5001,hold for these from those resulting on the basis of Euclidean plane,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,geometry. The surface is not a Euclidean continuum with respect to the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"rods, and we cannot define Cartesian co-ordinates in the surface.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,Gauss indicated the principles according to which we can treat the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"geometrical relationships in the surface, and thus pointed out the way","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"to the method of Riemman of treating multi-dimensional, non-Euclidean","Einstein, Albert"
5001,continuum. Thus it is that mathematicians long ago solved the formal,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,problems to which we are led by the general postulate of relativity.,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"According to Gauss, this combined analytical and geometrical mode of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,handling the problem can be arrived at in the following way. We,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,imagine a system of arbitrary curves (see Fig. 4) drawn on the surface,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of the table. These we designate as u-curves, and we indicate each of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"them by means of a number. The Curves u= 1, u= 2 and u= 3 are drawn in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the diagram. Between the curves u= 1 and u= 2 we must imagine an,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"infinitely large number to be drawn, all of which correspond to real","Einstein, Albert"
5001,numbers lying between 1 and 2. fig. 04 We have then a system of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"u-curves, and this ""infinitely dense"" system covers the whole surface","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of the table. These u-curves must not intersect each other, and","Einstein, Albert"
5001,through each point of the surface one and only one curve must pass.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Thus a perfectly definite value of u belongs to every point on the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,surface of the marble slab. In like manner we imagine a system of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,v-curves drawn on the surface. These satisfy the same conditions as,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the u-curves, they are provided with numbers in a corresponding","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"manner, and they may likewise be of arbitrary shape. It follows that a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,value of u and a value of v belong to every point on the surface of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the table. We call these two numbers the co-ordinates of the surface,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of the table (Gaussian co-ordinates). For example, the point P in the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"diagram has the Gaussian co-ordinates u= 3, v= 1. Two neighbouring","Einstein, Albert"
5001,points P and P1 on the surface then correspond to the co-ordinates,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"                       P:       u,v","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,where du and dv signify very small numbers. In a similar manner we may,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"indicate the distance (line-interval) between P and P1, as measured","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"with a little rod, by means of the very small number ds. Then","Einstein, Albert"
5001,according to Gauss we have,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,                ds2 = g[11]du2 + 2g[12]dudv = g[22]dv2,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"where g[11], g[12], g[22], are magnitudes which depend in a perfectly","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"definite way on u and v. The magnitudes g[11], g[12] and g[22],","Einstein, Albert"
5001,determine the behaviour of the rods relative to the u-curves and,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"v-curves, and thus also relative to the surface of the table. For the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,case in which the points of the surface considered form a Euclidean,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"continuum with reference to the measuring-rods, but only in this case,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,it is possible to draw the u-curves and v-curves and to attach numbers,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"to them, in such a manner, that we simply have :","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,                           ds2 = du2 + dv2,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Under these conditions, the u-curves and v-curves are straight lines","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"in the sense of Euclidean geometry, and they are perpendicular to each","Einstein, Albert"
5001,other. Here the Gaussian coordinates are samply Cartesian ones. It is,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,clear that Gauss co-ordinates are nothing more than an association of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"two sets of numbers with the points of the surface considered, of such","Einstein, Albert"
5001,a nature that numerical values differing very slightly from each other,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"So far, these considerations hold for a continuum of two dimensions.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"But the Gaussian method can be applied also to a continuum of three,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"four or more dimensions. If, for instance, a continuum of four","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"dimensions be supposed available, we may represent it in the following","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"way. With every point of the continuum, we associate arbitrarily four","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"numbers, x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], which are known as "" co-ordinates.""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,Adjacent points correspond to adjacent values of the coordinates. If a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"distance ds is associated with the adjacent points P and P1, this","Einstein, Albert"
5001,distance being measurable and well defined from a physical point of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"view, then the following formula holds:","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"ds2 = g[11]dx[1]^2 + 2g[12]dx[1]dx[2] . . . . g[44]dx[4]^2,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"where the magnitudes g[11], etc., have values which vary with the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,position in the continuum. Only when the continuum is a Euclidean one,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,is it possible to associate the co-ordinates x[1] . . x[4]. with the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,points of the continuum so that we have simply,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,ds2 = dx[1]^2 + dx[2]^2 + dx[3]^2 + dx[4]^2.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,In this case relations hold in the four-dimensional continuum which,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,are analogous to those holding in our three-dimensional measurements.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"However, the Gauss treatment for ds2 which we have given above is not","Einstein, Albert"
5001,always possible. It is only possible when sufficiently small regions,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of the continuum under consideration may be regarded as Euclidean,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"continua. For example, this obviously holds in the case of the marble","Einstein, Albert"
5001,slab of the table and local variation of temperature. The temperature,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"is practically constant for a small part of the slab, and thus the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,geometrical behaviour of the rods is almost as it ought to be,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,according to the rules of Euclidean geometry. Hence the imperfections,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of the construction of squares in the previous section do not show,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,themselves clearly until this construction is extended over a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,considerable portion of the surface of the table.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,We can sum this up as follows: Gauss invented a method for the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"mathematical treatment of continua in general, in which ""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"size-relations "" ("" distances "" between neighbouring points) are","Einstein, Albert"
5001,defined. To every point of a continuum are assigned as many numbers,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,(Gaussian coordinates) as the continuum has dimensions. This is done,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"in such a way, that only one meaning can be attached to the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"assignment, and that numbers (Gaussian coordinates) which differ by an","Einstein, Albert"
5001,indefinitely small amount are assigned to adjacent points. The,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Gaussian coordinate system is a logical generalisation of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Cartesian co-ordinate system. It is also applicable to non-Euclidean,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"continua, but only when, with respect to the defined ""size"" or","Einstein, Albert"

5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,We are now in a position to formulate more exactly the idea of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Minkowski, which was only vaguely indicated in Section 17. In","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"accordance with the special theory of relativity, certain co-ordinate","Einstein, Albert"
5001,systems are given preference for the description of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"four-dimensional, space-time continuum. We called these "" Galileian","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"co-ordinate systems."" For these systems, the four co-ordinates x, y,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"z, t, which determine an event or -- in other words, a point of the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,four-dimensional continuum -- are defined physically in a simple,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"manner, as set forth in detail in the first part of this book. For the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"transition from one Galileian system to another, which is moving","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"uniformly with reference to the first, the equations of the Lorentz","Einstein, Albert"
5001,transformation are valid. These last form the basis for the derivation,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of deductions from the special theory of relativity, and in themselves","Einstein, Albert"
5001,they are nothing more than the expression of the universal validity of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the law of transmission of light for all Galileian systems of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,reference.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Minkowski found that the Lorentz transformations satisfy the following,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"simple conditions. Let us consider two neighbouring events, the","Einstein, Albert"

5001,with respect to a Galileian reference-body K by the space co-ordinate,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"differences dx, dy, dz and the time-difference dt. With reference to a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,second Galileian system we shall suppose that the corresponding,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"differences for these two events are dx1, dy1, dz1, dt1. Then these","Einstein, Albert"
5001,magnitudes always fulfil the condition*,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,The validity of the Lorentz transformation follows from this,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,condition. We can express this as follows: The magnitude,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"                   ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 - c^2dt2,","Einstein, Albert"

5001,which belongs to two adjacent points of the four-dimensional,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"space-time continuum, has the same value for all selected (Galileian)","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"reference-bodies. If we replace x, y, z, sq. rt. -I . ct , by x[1],","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"x[2], x[3], x[4], we also obtaill the result that","Einstein, Albert"

5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,is independent of the choice of the body of reference. We call the,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,ECULIDEAN CONTINUUM,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,In the first part of this book we were able to make use of space-time,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,co-ordinates which allowed of a simple and direct physical,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"interpretation, and which, according to Section 26, can be regarded","Einstein, Albert"
5001,as four-dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. This was possible on the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,basis of the law of the constancy of the velocity of tight. But,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,according to Section 21 the general theory of relativity cannot,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"retain this law. On the contrary, we arrived at the result that","Einstein, Albert"
5001,according to this latter theory the velocity of light must always,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,depend on the co-ordinates when a gravitational field is present. In,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"connection with a specific illustration in Section 23, we found","Einstein, Albert"
5001,that the presence of a gravitational field invalidates the definition,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of the coordinates and the ifine, which led us to our objective in the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,special theory of relativity.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,In view of the resuIts of these considerations we are led to the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"conviction that, according to the general principle of relativity, the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"space-time continuum cannot be regarded as a Euclidean one, but that","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"here we have the general case, corresponding to the marble slab with","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"local variations of temperature, and with which we made acquaintance","Einstein, Albert"
5001,as an example of a two-dimensional continuum. Just as it was there,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,impossible to construct a Cartesian co-ordinate system from equal,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"rods, so here it is impossible to build up a system (reference-body)","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"from rigid bodies and clocks, which shall be of such a nature that","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"measuring-rods and clocks, arranged rigidly with respect to one","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"another, shaIll indicate position and time directly. Such was the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,essence of the difficulty with which we were confronted in Section,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,23.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,But the considerations of Sections 25 and 26 show us the way to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,surmount this difficulty. We refer the fourdimensional space-time,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,continuum in an arbitrary manner to Gauss co-ordinates. We assign to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"every point of the continuum (event) four numbers, x[1], x[2], x[3],","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"x[4] (co-ordinates), which have not the least direct physical","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"significance, but only serve the purpose of numbering the points of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the continuum in a definite but arbitrary manner. This arrangement,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"does not even need to be of such a kind that we must regard x[1],","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"x[2], x[3], as ""space"" co-ordinates and x[4], as a "" time ""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,co-ordinate.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,The reader may think that such a description of the world would be,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,quite inadequate. What does it mean to assign to an event the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"particular co-ordinates x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], if in themselves these","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"co-ordinates have no significance ? More careful consideration shows,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"however, that this anxiety is unfounded. Let us consider, for","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"instance, a material point with any kind of motion. If this point had","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"only a momentary existence without duration, then it would to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"described in space-time by a single system of values x[1], x[2], x[3],","Einstein, Albert"
5001,x[4]. Thus its permanent existence must be characterised by an,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"infinitely large number of such systems of values, the co-ordinate","Einstein, Albert"
5001,values of which are so close together as to give continuity;,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"corresponding to the material point, we thus have a (uni-dimensional)","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"line in the four-dimensional continuum. In the same way, any such","Einstein, Albert"
5001,lines in our continuum correspond to many points in motion. The only,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,statements having regard to these points which can claim a physical,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,existence are in reality the statements about their encounters. In our,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"mathematical treatment, such an encounter is expressed in the fact","Einstein, Albert"
5001,that the two lines which represent the motions of the points in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"question have a particular system of co-ordinate values, x[1], x[2],","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"x[3], x[4], in common. After mature consideration the reader will","Einstein, Albert"
5001,doubtless admit that in reality such encounters constitute the only,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,actual evidence of a time-space nature with which we meet in physical,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,statements.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,When we were describing the motion of a material point relative to a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"body of reference, we stated nothing more than the encounters of this","Einstein, Albert"
5001,point with particular points of the reference-body. We can also,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,determine the corresponding values of the time by the observation of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"encounters of the body with clocks, in conjunction with the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,observation of the encounter of the hands of clocks with particular,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,points on the dials. It is just the same in the case of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"space-measurements by means of measuring-rods, as a litttle","Einstein, Albert"
5001,consideration will show.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,The following statements hold generally : Every physical description,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"resolves itself into a number of statements, each of which refers to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the space-time coincidence of two events A and B. In terms of Gaussian,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"co-ordinates, every such statement is expressed by the agreement of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"their four co-ordinates x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4]. Thus in reality, the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,description of the time-space continuum by means of Gauss co-ordinates,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,completely replaces the description with the aid of a body of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"reference, without suffering from the defects of the latter mode of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,description; it is not tied down to the Euclidean character of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,continuum which has to be represented.,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,EXACT FORMULATION OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,We are now in a position to replace the pro. visional formulation of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the general principle of relativity given in Section 18 by an exact,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"formulation. The form there used, ""All bodies of reference K, K1,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"etc., are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"(formulation of the general laws of nature), whatever may be their","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"state of motion,"" cannot be maintained, because the use of rigid","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"reference-bodies, in the sense of the method followed in the special","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"theory of relativity, is in general not possible in space-time","Einstein, Albert"
5001,description. The Gauss co-ordinate system has to take the place of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,body of reference. The following statement corresponds to the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"fundamental idea of the general principle of relativity: ""All Gaussian","Einstein, Albert"
5001,co-ordinate systems are essentially equivalent for the formulation of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the general laws of nature.""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,We can state this general principle of relativity in still another,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"form, which renders it yet more clearly intelligible than it is when","Einstein, Albert"
5001,in the form of the natural extension of the special principle of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"relativity. According to the special theory of relativity, the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,equations which express the general laws of nature pass over into,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"equations of the same form when, by making use of the Lorentz","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"transformation, we replace the space-time variables x, y, z, t, of a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"(Galileian) reference-body K by the space-time variables x1, y1, z1,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"t1, of a new reference-body K1. According to the general theory of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"relativity, on the other hand, by application of arbitrary","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"substitutions of the Gauss variables x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,equations must pass over into equations of the same form; for every,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,transformation (not only the Lorentz transformation) corresponds to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the transition of one Gauss co-ordinate system into another.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"If we desire to adhere to our ""old-time"" three-dimensional view of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"things, then we can characterise the development which is being","Einstein, Albert"
5001,undergone by the fundamental idea of the general theory of relativity,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,as follows : The special theory of relativity has reference to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Galileian domains, i.e. to those in which no gravitational field","Einstein, Albert"
5001,exists. In this connection a Galileian reference-body serves as body,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of reference, i.e. a rigid body the state of motion of which is so","Einstein, Albert"
5001,chosen that the Galileian law of the uniform rectilinear motion of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"""isolated"" material points holds relatively to it.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Certain considerations suggest that we should refer the same Galileian,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,domains to non-Galileian reference-bodies also. A gravitational field,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of a special kind is then present with respect to these bodies (cf.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Sections 20 and 23).,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,In gravitational fields there are no such things as rigid bodies with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Euclidean properties; thus the fictitious rigid body of reference is,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of no avail in the general theory of relativity. The motion of clocks,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"is also influenced by gravitational fields, and in such a way that a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,physical definition of time which is made directly with the aid of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,clocks has by no means the same degree of plausibility as in the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,special theory of relativity.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"For this reason non-rigid reference-bodies are used, which are as a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"whole not only moving in any way whatsoever, but which also suffer","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"alterations in form ad lib. during their motion. Clocks, for which the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"law of motion is of any kind, however irregular, serve for the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,definition of time. We have to imagine each of these clocks fixed at a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,point on the non-rigid reference-body. These clocks satisfy only the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"one condition, that the ""readings"" which are observed simultaneously","Einstein, Albert"
5001,on adjacent clocks (in space) differ from each other by an,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"indefinitely small amount. This non-rigid reference-body, which might","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"appropriately be termed a ""reference-mollusc"", is in the main","Einstein, Albert"
5001,equivalent to a Gaussian four-dimensional co-ordinate system chosen,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"arbitrarily. That which gives the ""mollusc"" a certain","Einstein, Albert"
5001,comprehensibility as compared with the Gauss co-ordinate system is the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,(really unjustified) formal retention of the separate existence of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,space co-ordinates as opposed to the time co-ordinate. Every point on,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the mollusc is treated as a space-point, and every material point","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"which is at rest relatively to it as at rest, so long as the mollusc","Einstein, Albert"
5001,is considered as reference-body. The general principle of relativity,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,requires that all these molluscs can be used as reference-bodies with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,equal right and equal success in the formulation of the general laws,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of nature; the laws themselves must be quite independent of the choice,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of mollusc.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,The great power possessed by the general principle of relativity lies,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,in the comprehensive limitation which is imposed on the laws of nature,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,in which there is no gravitational field relative to the Galileian,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,reference-body K. The behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"reference to K is known from the special theory of relativity,","Einstein, Albert"

5001,uniformly and in straight lines.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Now let us refer this domain to a random Gauss coordinate system or to,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,gravitational field G (of a particular kind). We learn the behaviour,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of measuring-rods and clocks and also of freely-moving material points,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,with reference to K1 simply by mathematical transformation. We,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"interpret this behaviour as the behaviour of measuring-rods, docks and","Einstein, Albert"
5001,material points tinder the influence of the gravitational field G.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Hereupon we introduce a hypothesis: that the influence of the,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,"material points continues to take place according to the same laws,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,even in the case where the prevailing gravitational field is not,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,transformation of co-ordinates.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,The next step is to investigate the space-time behaviour of the,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,following demands:,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,(a) The required generalisation must likewise satisfy the general,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,postulate of relativity.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"(b) If there is any matter in the domain under consideration, only its","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"inertial mass, and thus according to Section 15 only its energy is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,of importance for its etfect in exciting a field.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,(c) Gravitational field and matter together must satisfy the law of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the conservation of energy (and of impulse).,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Finally, the general principle of relativity permits us to determine","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the influence of the gravitational field on the course of all those,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,processes which take place according to known laws when a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,gravitational field is absent i.e. which have already been fitted into,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the frame of the special theory of relativity. In this connection we,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,proceed in principle according to the method which has already been,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"explained for measuring-rods, clocks and freely moving material","Einstein, Albert"
5001,points.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,The theory of gravitation derived in this way from the general,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,postulate of relativity excels not only in its beauty ; nor in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,removing the defect attaching to classical mechanics which was brought,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,to light in Section 21; nor in interpreting the empirical law of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the equality of inertial and gravitational mass ; but it has also,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"already explained a result of observation in astronomy, against which","Einstein, Albert"
5001,classical mechanics is powerless.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,If we confine the application of the theory to the case where the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"gravitational fields can be regarded as being weak, and in which all","Einstein, Albert"
5001,masses move with respect to the coordinate system with velocities,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"which are small compared with the velocity of light, we then obtain as","Einstein, Albert"
5001,a first approximation the Newtonian theory. Thus the latter theory is,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"obtained here without any particular assumption, whereas Newton had to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,introduce the hypothesis that the force of attraction between mutually,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,attracting material points is inversely proportional to the square of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the distance between them. If we increase the accuracy of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"calculation, deviations from the theory of Newton make their","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"appearance, practically all of which must nevertheless escape the test","Einstein, Albert"
5001,of observation owing to their smallness.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,We must draw attention here to one of these deviations. According to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Newton's theory, a planet moves round the sun in an ellipse, which","Einstein, Albert"
5001,would permanently maintain its position with respect to the fixed,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"stars, if we could disregard the motion of the fixed stars themselves","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"and the action of the other planets under consideration. Thus, if we","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"correct the observed motion of the planets for these two influences,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"and if Newton's theory be strictly correct, we ought to obtain for the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"orbit of the planet an ellipse, which is fixed with reference to the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"fixed stars. This deduction, which can be tested with great accuracy,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"has been confirmed for all the planets save one, with the precision","Einstein, Albert"
5001,that is capable of being obtained by the delicacy of observation,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"attainable at the present time. The sole exception is Mercury, the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"planet which lies nearest the sun. Since the time of Leverrier, it has","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"been known that the ellipse corresponding to the orbit of Mercury,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"after it has been corrected for the influences mentioned above, is not","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"stationary with respect to the fixed stars, but that it rotates","Einstein, Albert"
5001,exceedingly slowly in the plane of the orbit and in the sense of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,orbital motion. The value obtained for this rotary movement of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"orbital ellipse was 43 seconds of arc per century, an amount ensured","Einstein, Albert"
5001,to be correct to within a few seconds of arc. This effect can be,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,explained by means of classical mechanics only on the assumption of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"hypotheses which have little probability, and which were devised","Einstein, Albert"
5001,solely for this purponse.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"On the basis of the general theory of relativity, it is found that the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,ellipse of every planet round the sun must necessarily rotate in the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"manner indicated above ; that for all the planets, with the exception","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of Mercury, this rotation is too small to be detected with the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,delicacy of observation possible at the present time ; but that in the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"case of Mercury it must amount to 43 seconds of arc per century, a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,result which is strictly in agreement with observation.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Apart from this one, it has hitherto been possible to make only two","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"deductions from the theory which admit of being tested by observation,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"to wit, the curvature of light rays by the gravitational field of the","Einstein, Albert"

5001,"Part from the difficulty discussed in Section 21, there is a second","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"fundamental difficulty attending classical celestial mechanics, which,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"to the best of my knowledge, was first discussed in detail by the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,astronomer Seeliger. If we ponder over the question as to how the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"universe, considered as a whole, is to be regarded, the first answer","Einstein, Albert"
5001,that suggests itself to us is surely this: As regards space (and time),"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the universe is infinite. There are stars everywhere, so that the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"density of matter, although very variable in detail, is nevertheless","Einstein, Albert"
5001,on the average everywhere the same. In other words: However far we,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"might travel through space, we should find everywhere an attenuated","Einstein, Albert"
5001,swarm of fixed stars of approrimately the same kind and density.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,This view is not in harmony with the theory of Newton. The latter,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,theory rather requires that the universe should have a kind of centre,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"in which the density of the stars is a maximum, and that as we proceed","Einstein, Albert"
5001,outwards from this centre the group-density of the stars should,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"diminish, until finally, at great distances, it is succeeded by an","Einstein, Albert"
5001,infinite region of emptiness. The stellar universe ought to be a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,finite island in the infinite ocean of space.*,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,This conception is in itself not very satisfactory. It is still less,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,satisfactory because it leads to the result that the light emitted by,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the stars and also individual stars of the stellar system are,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"perpetually passing out into infinite space, never to return, and","Einstein, Albert"
5001,without ever again coming into interaction with other objects of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,nature. Such a finite material universe would be destined to become,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,gradually but systematically impoverished.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"In order to escape this dilemma, Seeliger suggested a modification of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Newton's law, in which he assumes that for great distances the force","Einstein, Albert"
5001,of attraction between two masses diminishes more rapidly than would,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,result from the inverse square law. In this way it is possible for the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"mean density of matter to be constant everywhere, even to infinity,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,without infinitely large gravitational fields being produced. We thus,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,free ourselves from the distasteful conception that the material,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,universe ought to possess something of the nature of a centre. Of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,course we purchase our emancipation from the fundamental difficulties,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"mentioned, at the cost of a modification and complication of Newton's","Einstein, Albert"
5001,law which has neither empirical nor theoretical foundation. We can,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"imagine innumerable laws which would serve the same purpose, without","Einstein, Albert"
5001,our being able to state a reason why one of them is to be preferred to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the others ; for any one of these laws would be founded just as little,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,on more general theoretical principles as is the law of Newton.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,"*) Proof -- According to the theory of Newton, the number of ""lines","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of force"" which come from infinity and terminate in a mass m is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"proportional to the mass m. If, on the average, the Mass density p[0]","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"is constant throughout tithe universe, then a sphere of volume V will","Einstein, Albert"
5001,enclose the average man p[0]V. Thus the number of lines of force,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,passing through the surface F of the sphere into its interior is,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,proportional to p[0] V. For unit area of the surface of the sphere the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,number of lines of force which enters the sphere is thus proportional,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,to p[0] V/F or to p[0]R. Hence the intensity of the field at the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,surface would ultimately become infinite with increasing radius R of,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,But speculations on the structure of the universe also move in quite,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,another direction. The development of non-Euclidean geometry led to,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the recognition of the fact, that we can cast doubt on the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,infiniteness of our space without coming into conflict with the laws,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of thought or with experience (Riemann, Helmholtz). These questions","Einstein, Albert"
5001,have already been treated in detail and with unsurpassable lucidity by,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Helmholtz and Poincar, whereas I can only touch on them briefly here.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"In the first place, we imagine an existence in two dimensional space.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Flat beings with flat implements, and in particular flat rigid","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"measuring-rods, are free to move in a plane. For them nothing exists","Einstein, Albert"
5001,outside of this plane: that which they observe to happen to themselves,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"and to their flat "" things "" is the all-inclusive reality of their","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"plane. In particular, the constructions of plane Euclidean geometry","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"can be carried out by means of the rods e.g. the lattice construction,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"considered in Section 24. In contrast to ours, the universe of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"these beings is two-dimensional; but, like ours, it extends to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,infinity. In their universe there is room for an infinite number of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"identical squares made up of rods, i.e. its volume (surface) is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"infinite. If these beings say their universe is "" plane,"" there is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"sense in the statement, because they mean that they can perform the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,constructions of plane Euclidean geometry with their rods. In this,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"connection the individual rods always represent the same distance,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,independently of their position.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Let us consider now a second two-dimensional existence, but this time","Einstein, Albert"
5001,on a spherical surface instead of on a plane. The flat beings with,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,their measuring-rods and other objects fit exactly on this surface and,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,they are unable to leave it. Their whole universe of observation,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,extends exclusively over the surface of the sphere. Are these beings,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,able to regard the geometry of their universe as being plane geometry,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"and their rods withal as the realisation of "" distance "" ? They cannot","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"do this. For if they attempt to realise a straight line, they will","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"obtain a curve, which we "" three-dimensional beings "" designate as a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"great circle, i.e. a self-contained line of definite finite length,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"which can be measured up by means of a measuring-rod. Similarly, this","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"universe has a finite area that can be compared with the area, of a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,square constructed with rods. The great charm resulting from this,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,consideration lies in the recognition of the fact that the universe of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,these beings is finite and yet has no limits.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,But the spherical-surface beings do not need to go on a world-tour in,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,order to perceive that they are not living in a Euclidean universe.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"They can convince themselves of this on every part of their "" world,""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,provided they do not use too small a piece of it. Starting from a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"point, they draw "" straight lines "" (arcs of circles as judged in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,three dimensional space) of equal length in all directions. They will,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"call the line joining the free ends of these lines a "" circle."" For a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"plane surface, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"diameter, both lengths being measured with the same rod, is, according","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"to Euclidean geometry of the plane, equal to a constant value p, which","Einstein, Albert"
5001,is independent of the diameter of the circle. On their spherical,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,"i.e. a smaller value than p, the difference being the more","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"considerable, the greater is the radius of the circle in comparison","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"with the radius R of the "" world-sphere."" By means of this relation","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the spherical beings can determine the radius of their universe (""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"world ""), even when only a relatively small part of their worldsphere","Einstein, Albert"
5001,is available for their measurements. But if this part is very small,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"indeed, they will no longer be able to demonstrate that they are on a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"spherical "" world "" and not on a Euclidean plane, for a small part of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,a spherical surface differs only slightly from a piece of a plane of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the same size.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Thus if the spherical surface beings are living on a planet of which,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the solar system occupies only a negligibly small part of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"spherical universe, they have no means of determining whether they are","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"living in a finite or in an infinite universe, because the "" piece of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"universe "" to which they have access is in both cases practically","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"plane, or Euclidean. It follows directly from this discussion, that","Einstein, Albert"
5001,for our sphere-beings the circumference of a circle first increases,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"with the radius until the "" circumference of the universe "" is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"reached, and that it thenceforward gradually decreases to zero for","Einstein, Albert"
5001,still further increasing values of the radius. During this process the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"area of the circle continues to increase more and more, until finally","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"it becomes equal to the total area of the whole "" world-sphere.""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Perhaps the reader will wonder why we have placed our "" beings "" on a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,sphere rather than on another closed surface. But this choice has its,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"justification in the fact that, of all closed surfaces, the sphere is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,unique in possessing the property that all points on it are,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,equivalent. I admit that the ratio of the circumference c of a circle,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"to its radius r depends on r, but for a given value of r it is the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"same for all points of the "" worldsphere ""; in other words, the ""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"world-sphere "" is a "" surface of constant curvature.""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,To this two-dimensional sphere-universe there is a three-dimensional,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"analogy, namely, the three-dimensional spherical space which was","Einstein, Albert"
5001,discovered by Riemann. its points are likewise all equivalent. It,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"possesses a finite volume, which is determined by its ""radius""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,(2p2R3). Is it possible to imagine a spherical space? To imagine a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"space means nothing else than that we imagine an epitome of our ""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"space "" experience, i.e. of experience that we can have in the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"movement of "" rigid "" bodies. In this sense we can imagine a spherical","Einstein, Albert"
5001,space.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,Suppose we draw lines or stretch strings in all directions from a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"point, and mark off from each of these the distance r with a","Einstein, Albert"
5001,measuring-rod. All the free end-points of these lengths lie on a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,spherical surface. We can specially measure up the area (F) of this,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,surface by means of a square made up of measuring-rods. If the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"universe is Euclidean, then F = 4pR2 ; if it is spherical, then F is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"always less than 4pR2. With increasing values of r, F increases from","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"zero up to a maximum value which is determined by the "" world-radius,""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"but for still further increasing values of r, the area gradually","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"diminishes to zero. At first, the straight lines which radiate from","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the starting point diverge farther and farther from one another, but","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"later they approach each other, and finally they run together again at","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"a ""counter-point"" to the starting point. Under such conditions they","Einstein, Albert"
5001,have traversed the whole spherical space. It is easily seen that the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,three-dimensional spherical space is quite analogous to the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,two-dimensional spherical surface. It is finite (i.e. of finite,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"volume), and has no bounds.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"It may be mentioned that there is yet another kind of curved space: ""","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"elliptical space."" It can be regarded as a curved space in which the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"two "" counter-points "" are identical (indistinguishable from each","Einstein, Albert"
5001,other). An elliptical universe can thus be considered to some extent,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,as a curved universe possessing central symmetry.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"It follows from what has been said, that closed spaces without limits","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"are conceivable. From amongst these, the spherical space (and the","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"elliptical) excels in its simplicity, since all points on it are","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"equivalent. As a result of this discussion, a most interesting","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"question arises for astronomers and physicists, and that is whether","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"the universe in which we live is infinite, or whether it is finite in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,the manner of the spherical universe. Our experience is far from being,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,sufficient to enable us to answer this question. But the general,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,theory of relativity permits of our answering it with a moduate degree,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of certainty, and in this connection the difficulty mentioned in","Einstein, Albert"
5001,Section 30 finds its solution.,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,THE STRUCTURE OF SPACE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"According to the general theory of relativity, the geometrical","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"properties of space are not independent, but they are determined by","Einstein, Albert"
5001,matter. Thus we can draw conclusions about the geometrical structure,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,of the universe only if we base our considerations on the state of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"matter as being something that is known. We know from experience that,","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"for a suitably chosen co-ordinate system, the velocities of the stars","Einstein, Albert"
5001,are small as compared with the velocity of transmission of light. We,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,can thus as a rough approximation arrive at a conclusion as to the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"nature of the universe as a whole, if we treat the matter as being at","Einstein, Albert"
5001,rest.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,We already know from our previous discussion that the behaviour of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"measuring-rods and clocks is influenced by gravitational fields, i.e.","Einstein, Albert"
5001,by the distribution of matter. This in itself is sufficient to exclude,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,the possibility of the exact validity of Euclidean geometry in our,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,universe. But it is conceivable that our universe differs only,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"slightly from a Euclidean one, and this notion seems all the more","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"probable, since calculations show that the metrics of surrounding","Einstein, Albert"
5001,space is influenced only to an exceedingly small extent by masses even,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"of the magnitude of our sun. We might imagine that, as regards","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"geometry, our universe behaves analogously to a surface which is","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"irregularly curved in its individual parts, but which nowhere departs","Einstein, Albert"
5001,appreciably from a plane: something like the rippled surface of a,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,lake. Such a universe might fittingly be called a quasi-Euclidean,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,universe. As regards its space it would be infinite. But calculation,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,shows that in a quasi-Euclidean universe the average density of matter,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,would necessarily be nil. Thus such a universe could not be inhabited,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,by matter everywhere ; it would present to us that unsatisfactory,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,picture which we portrayed in Section 30.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,If we are to have in the universe an average density of matter which,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"differs from zero, however small may be that difference, then the","Einstein, Albert"

5001,curvature being similar to that experienced by the path of a body,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,which is projected through a gravitational field. As a result of this,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"theory, we should expect that a ray of light which is passing close to","Einstein, Albert"
5001,a heavenly body would be deviated towards the latter. For a ray of,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,light which passes the sun at a distance of D sun-radii from its,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,This result admits of an experimental test by means of the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,photographic registration of stars during a total eclipse of the sun.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,The only reason why we must wait for a total eclipse is because at,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,every other time the atmosphere is so strongly illuminated by the,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,light from the sun that the stars situated near the sun's disc are,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,invisible. The predicted effect can be seen clearly from the,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,"practically infinitely distant would be seen in the direction D[1], as","Einstein, Albert"

5001,"In the first place, we see from this expression that two clocks of","Einstein, Albert"
5001,identical construction will go at different rates when situated at,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,My original considerations on the subject were based on two,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,(1) There exists an average density of matter in the whole of space,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,which is everywhere the same and different from zero.,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,"view ("" cosmological term of the field equations "").","Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"Hypothesis (2) appeared unavoidable to me at the time, since I thought","Einstein, Albert"

5001,it.,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"However, already in the 'twenties, the Russian mathematician Friedman","Einstein, Albert"
5001,showed that a different hypothesis was natural from a purely,"Einstein, Albert"

5001,preserve hypothesis (1) without introducing the less natural,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"cosmological term into the field equations of gravitation, if one was","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"ready to drop hypothesis (2). Namely, the original field equations","Einstein, Albert"
5001,"admit a solution in which the "" world radius "" depends on time","Einstein, Albert"

5001,,"Einstein, Albert"
5001,"A few years later Hubble showed, by a special investigation of the","Einstein, Albert"

13476,"Gospic he spent four years in the public school, and later, three","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"years in the Real School, as it is called. His escapades were such as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"most quick witted boys go through, although he varied the programme on","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,one occasion by getting imprisoned in a remote mountain chapel rarely,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,visited for service; and on another occasion by falling headlong into,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"a huge kettle of boiling milk, just drawn from the paternal herds. A","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"third curious episode was that connected with his efforts to fly when,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"attempting to navigate the air with the aid of an old umbrella, he","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"had, as might be expected, a very bad fall, and was laid up for six","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,weeks.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,About this period he began to take delight in arithmetic and physics.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,One queer notion he had was to work out everything by three or the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"power of three. He was now sent to an aunt at Cartstatt, Croatia, to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,finish his studies in what is known as the Higher Real School. It was,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"there that, coming from the rural fastnesses, he saw a steam engine","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,for the first time with a pleasure that he remembers to this day. At,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Cartstatt he was so diligent as to compress the four years' course,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"into three, and graduated in 1873. Returning home during an epidemic","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of cholera, he was stricken down by the disease and suffered so","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,seriously from the consequences that his studies were interrupted for,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"fully two years. But the time was not wasted, for he had become","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"passionately fond of experimenting, and as much as his means and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,leisure permitted devoted his energies to electrical study and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,investigation. Up to this period it had been his father's intention to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"make a priest of him, and the idea hung over the young physicist like","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,a very sword of Damocles. Finally he prevailed upon his worthy but,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,reluctant sire to send him to Gratz in Austria to finish his studies,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"at the Polytechnic School, and to prepare for work as professor of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,mathematics and physics. At Gratz he saw and operated a Gramme machine,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"for the first time, and was so struck with the objections to the use","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of commutators and brushes that he made up his mind there and then to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,remedy that defect in dynamo-electric machines. In the second year of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,his course he abandoned the intention of becoming a teacher and took,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,up the engineering curriculum. After three years of absence he,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"returned home, sadly, to see his father die; but, having resolved to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"settle down in Austria, and recognizing the value of linguistic","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"acquirements, he went to Prague and then to Buda-Pesth with the view","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of mastering the languages he deemed necessary. Up to this time he had,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,never realized the enormous sacrifices that his parents had made in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"promoting his education, but he now began to feel the pinch and to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,grow unfamiliar with the image of Francis Joseph I. There was,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,considerable lag between his dispatches and the corresponding,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,remittance from home; and when the mathematical expression for the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"value of the lag assumed the shape of an eight laid flat on its back,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Mr. Tesla became a very fair example of high thinking and plain,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"living, but he made up his mind to the struggle and determined to go","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,through depending solely on his own resources. Not desiring the fame,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of a faster, he cast about for a livelihood, and through the help of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,friends he secured a berth as assistant in the engineering department,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of the government telegraphs. The salary was five dollars a week. This,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,brought him into direct contact with practical electrical work and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"ideas, but it is needless to say that his means did not admit of much","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,experimenting. By the time he had extracted several hundred thousand,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"square and cube roots for the public benefit, the limitations,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"financial and otherwise, of the position had become painfully","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"apparent, and he concluded that the best thing to do was to make a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"valuable invention. He proceeded at once to make inventions, but their","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"value was visible only to the eye of faith, and they brought no grist","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to the mill. Just at this time the telephone made its appearance in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Hungary, and the success of that great invention determined his","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"career, hopeless as the profession had thus far seemed to him. He","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"associated himself at once with telephonic work, and made various","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"telephonic inventions, including an operative repeater; but it did not","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"take him long to discover that, being so remote from the scenes of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"electrical activity, he was apt to spend time on aims and results","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"already reached by others, and to lose touch. Longing for new","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,opportunities and anxious for the development of which he felt himself,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"possible, if once he could place himself within the genial and direct","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"influences of the gulf streams of electrical thought, he broke away","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"from the ties and traditions of the past, and in 1881 made his way to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Paris. Arriving in that city, the ardent young Likan obtained","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,employment as an electrical engineer with one of the largest electric,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,lighting companies. The next year he went to Strasburg to install a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"plant, and on returning to Paris sought to carry out a number of ideas","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"that had now ripened into inventions. About this time, however, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,remarkable progress of America in electrical industry attracted his,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"attention, and once again staking everything on a single throw, he","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,crossed the Atlantic.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Mr. Tesla buckled down to work as soon as he landed on these shores,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"put his best thought and skill into it, and soon saw openings for his","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,talent. In a short while a proposition was made to him to start his,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"own company, and, accepting the terms, he at once worked up a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"practical system of arc lighting, as well as a potential method of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"dynamo regulation, which in one form is now known as the ""third brush","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"regulation."" He also devised a thermo-magnetic motor and other kindred","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"devices, about which little was published, owing to legal","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,complications. Early in 1887 the Tesla Electric Company of New York,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"was formed, and not long after that Mr. Tesla produced his admirable","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and epoch-marking motors for multiphase alternating currents, in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"which, going back to his ideas of long ago, he evolved machines having","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,neither commutator nor brushes. It will be remembered that about the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"time that Mr. Tesla brought out his motors, and read his thoughtful","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"paper before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Professor","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Ferraris, in Europe, published his discovery of principles analogous","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to those enunciated by Mr. Tesla. There is no doubt, however, that Mr.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Tesla was an independent inventor of this rotary field motor, for","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"although anticipated in dates by Ferraris, he could not have known","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,about Ferraris' work as it had not been published. Professor Ferraris,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"stated himself, with becoming modesty, that he did not think Tesla","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"could have known of his (Ferraris') experiments at that time, and adds","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,that he thinks Tesla was an independent and original inventor of this,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,principle. With such an acknowledgment from Ferraris there can be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,little doubt about Tesla's originality in this matter.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Mr. Tesla's work in this field was wonderfully timely, and its worth","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,was promptly appreciated in various quarters. The Tesla patents were,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"acquired by the Westinghouse Electric Company, who undertook to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,develop his motor and to apply it to work of different kinds. Its use,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in mining, and its employment in printing, ventilation, etc., was","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,described and illustrated in _The Electrical World_ some years ago.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The immense stimulus that the announcement of Mr. Tesla's work gave to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the study of alternating current motors would, in itself, be enough to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,stamp him as a leader.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Mr. Tesla is only 35 years of age. He is tall and spare with a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"clean-cut, thin, refined face, and eyes that recall all the stories","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,one has read of keenness of vision and phenomenal ability to see,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"through things. He is an omnivorous reader, who never forgets; and he","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,possesses the peculiar facility in languages that enables the least,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,educated native of eastern Europe to talk and write in at least half a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,dozen tongues. A more congenial companion cannot be desired for the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"hours when one ""pours out heart affluence in discursive talk,"" and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"when the conversation, dealing at first with things near at hand and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"next to us, reaches out and rises to the greater questions of life,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,duty and destiny.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,In the year 1890 he severed his connection with the Westinghouse,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Company, since which time he has devoted himself entirely to the study","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of alternating currents of high frequencies and very high potentials,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,with which study he is at present engaged. No comment is necessary on,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,his interesting achievements in this field; the famous London lecture,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,published in this volume is a proof in itself. His first lecture on,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"his researches in this new branch of electricity, which he may be said","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to have created, was delivered before the American Institute of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Electrical Engineers on May 20, 1891, and remains one of the most","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,interesting papers read before that society. It will be found,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"reprinted in full in _The Electrical World_, July 11, 1891. Its","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,publication excited such interest abroad that he received numerous,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,requests from English and French electrical engineers and scientists,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to repeat it in those countries, the result of which has been the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,interesting lecture published in this volume.,"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,I need not mention many names which are world-known--names of those,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,among you who are recognized as the leaders in this enchanting,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"science; but one, at least, I must mention--a name which could not be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,omitted in a demonstration of this kind. It is a name associated with,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the most beautiful invention ever made: it is Crookes!,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"When I was at college, a good time ago, I read, in a translation (for","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"then I was not familiar with your magnificent language), the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,description of his experiments on radiant matter. I read it only once,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,in my life--that time--yet every detail about that charming work I,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"can remember this day. Few are the books, let me say, which can make","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,such an impression upon the mind of a student.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"But if, on the present occasion, I mention this name as one of many","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"your institution can boast of, it is because I have more than one","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,reason to do so. For what I have to tell you and to show you this,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"evening concerns, in a large measure, that same vague world which","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Professor Crookes has so ably explored; and, more than this, when I","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,trace back the mental process which led me to these advances--which,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"even by myself cannot be considered trifling, since they are so","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"appreciated by you--I believe that their real origin, that which","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"started me to work in this direction, and brought me to them, after a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"long period of constant thought, was that fascinating little book","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,which I read many years ago.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,And now that I have made a feeble effort to express my homage and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"acknowledge my indebtedness to him and others among you, I will make a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"second effort, which I hope you will not find so feeble as the first,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to entertain you.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Give me leave to introduce the subject in a few words.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,A short time ago I had the honor to bring before our American,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Institute of Electrical Engineers[A] some results then arrived at by,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,me in a novel line of work. I need not assure you that the many,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,evidences which I have received that English scientific men and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,engineers were interested in this work have been for me a great,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,reward and encouragement. I will not dwell upon the experiments,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"already described, except with the view of completing, or more clearly","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"expressing, some ideas advanced by me before, and also with the view","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of rendering the study here presented self-contained, and my remarks","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,on the subject of this evening's lecture consistent.,"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,"This investigation, then, it goes without saying, deals with","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"alternating currents, and, to be more precise, with alternating","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,currents of high potential and high frequency. Just in how much a very,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,high frequency is essential for the production of the results,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"presented is a question which even with my present experience, would","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,embarrass me to answer. Some of the experiments may be performed with,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"low frequencies; but very high frequencies are desirable, not only on","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"account of the many effects secured by their use, but also as a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"convenient means of obtaining, in the induction apparatus employed,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the high potentials, which in their turn are necessary to the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,demonstration of most of the experiments here contemplated.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Of the various branches of electrical investigation, perhaps the most","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,interesting and immediately the most promising is that dealing with,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,alternating currents. The progress in this branch of applied science,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,has been so great in recent years that it justifies the most sanguine,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"hopes. Hardly have we become familiar with one fact, when novel","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,experiences are met with and new avenues of research are opened. Even,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"at this hour possibilities not dreamed of before are, by the use of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"these currents, partly realized. As in nature all is ebb and tide, all","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is wave motion, so it seems that; in all branches of industry","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,alternating currents--electric wave motion--will have the sway.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"One reason, perhaps, why this branch of science is being so rapidly","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,developed is to be found in the interest which is attached to its,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,experimental study. We wind a simple ring of iron with coils; we,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"establish the connections to the generator, and with wonder and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,delight we note the effects of strange forces which we bring into,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"play, which allow us to transform, to transmit and direct energy at","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"will. We arrange the circuits properly, and we see the mass of iron","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and wires behave as though it were endowed with life, spinning a heavy","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"armature, through invisible connections, with great speed and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,power--with the energy possibly conveyed from a great distance. We,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,observe how the energy of an alternating current traversing the wire,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,manifests itself--not so much in the wire as in the surrounding,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"space--in the most surprising manner, taking the forms of heat, light,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"mechanical energy, and, most surprising of all, even chemical","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"affinity. All these observations fascinate us, and fill us with an","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,intense desire to know more about the nature of these phenomena. Each,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"day we go to our work in the hope of discovering,--in the hope that","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"some one, no matter who, may find a solution of one of the pending","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"great problems,--and each succeeding day we return to our task with","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"renewed ardor; and even if we _are_ unsuccessful, our work has not","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"been in vain, for in these strivings, in these efforts, we have found","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"hours of untold pleasure, and we have directed our energies to the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,benefit of mankind.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"We may take--at random, if you choose--any of the many experiments","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,which may be performed with alternating currents; a few of which,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"only, and by no means the most striking, form the subject of this","Tesla, Nikola"

13476,"have had a steady companion, an appliance familiar to every one, a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"plaything once, a thing of momentous importance now--the induction","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,coil. There is no dearer appliance to the electrician. From the ablest,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"among you, I dare say, down to the inexperienced student, to your","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"lecturer, we all have passed many delightful hours in experimenting","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"with the induction coil. We have watched its play, and thought and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,pondered over the beautiful phenomena which it disclosed to our,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"ravished eyes. So well known is this apparatus, so familiar are these","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"phenomena to every one, that my courage nearly fails me when I think","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"that I have ventured to address so able an audience, that I have","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,ventured to entertain you with that same old subject. Here in reality,"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,"apparatus is operated somewhat differently, the phenomena are","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,presented in a different aspect. Some of the results we find as,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"expected, others surprise us, but all captivate our attention, for in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,scientific investigation each novel result achieved may be the centre,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of a new departure, each novel fact learned may lead to important","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,developments.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Usually in operating an induction coil we have set up a vibration of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"moderate frequency in the primary, either by means of an interrupter","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"or break, or by the use of an alternator. Earlier English","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"investigators, to mention only Spottiswoode and J.E.H. Gordon, have","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,used a rapid break in connection with the coil. Our knowledge and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,experience of to-day enables us to see clearly why these coils under,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the conditions of the tests did not disclose any remarkable phenomena,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and why able experimenters failed to perceive many of the curious,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,effects which have since been observed.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"In the experiments such as performed this evening, we operate the coil","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,either from a specially constructed alternator capable of giving many,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"thousands of reversals of current per second, or, by disruptively","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"discharging a condenser through the primary, we set up a vibration in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the secondary circuit of a frequency of many hundred thousand or,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"millions per second, if we so desire; and in using either of these","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,means we enter a field as yet unexplored.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,It is impossible to pursue an investigation in any novel line without,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,finally making some interesting observation or learning some useful,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,fact. That this statement is applicable to the subject of this lecture,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the many curious and unexpected phenomena which we observe afford a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"convincing proof. By way of illustration, take for instance the most","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"obvious phenomena, those of the discharge of the induction coil.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Here is a coil which is operated by currents vibrating with extreme,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"rapidity, obtained by disruptively discharging a Leyden jar. It would","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,not surprise a student were the lecturer to say that the secondary of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,this coil consists of a small length of comparatively stout wire; it,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"would not surprise him were the lecturer to state that, in spite of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"this, the coil is capable of giving any potential which the best","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,insulation of the turns is able to withstand: but although he may be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"prepared, and even be indifferent as to the anticipated result, yet","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the aspect of the discharge of the coil will surprise and interest,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,him. Every one is familiar with the discharge of an ordinary coil; it,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"need not be reproduced here. But, by way of contrast, here is a form","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of discharge of a coil, the primary current of which is vibrating","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,several hundred thousand times per second. The discharge of an,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,ordinary coil appears as a simple line or band of light. The discharge,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of this coil appears in the form of powerful brushes and luminous,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,streams issuing from all points of the two straight wires attached to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the terminals of the secondary. (Fig. 1.),"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,OF A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND PER SECOND.],"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Now compare this phenomenon which you have just witnessed with the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,discharge of a Holtz or Wimshurst machine--that other interesting,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,appliance so dear to the experimenter. What a difference there is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"between these phenomena! And yet, had I made the necessary","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"arrangements--which could have been made easily, were it not that they","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,would interfere with other experiments--I could have produced with,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"this coil sparks which, had I the coil hidden from your view and only","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"two knobs exposed, even the keenest observer among you would find it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish from those of an","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,influence or friction machine. This may be done in many ways--for,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"instance, by operating the induction coil which charges the condenser","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"from an alternating-current machine of very low frequency, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,preferably adjusting the discharge circuit so that there are no,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"oscillations set up in it. We then obtain in the secondary circuit, if","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the knobs are of the required size and properly set, a more or less","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"rapid succession of sparks of great intensity and small quantity,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"which possess the same brilliancy, and are accompanied by the same","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"sharp crackling sound, as those obtained from a friction or influence","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,machine.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Another way is to pass through two primary circuits, having a common","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"secondary, two currents of a slightly different period, which produce","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,in the secondary circuit sparks occurring at comparatively long,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"intervals. But, even with the means at hand this evening, I may","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,succeed in imitating the spark of a Holtz machine. For this purpose I,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,establish between the terminals of the coil which charges the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"condenser a long, unsteady arc, which is periodically interrupted by","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the upward current of air produced by it. To increase the current of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"air I place on each side of the arc, and close to it, a large plate of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,mica. The condenser charged from this coil discharges into the primary,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"circuit of a second coil through a small air gap, which is necessary","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to produce a sudden rush of current through the primary. The scheme of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,connections in the present experiment is indicated in Fig. 2.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,"an induction coil, the secondary S of which charges the condensers or","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,jars CC. The terminals of the secondary are connected to the inside,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"coatings of the jars, the outer coatings being connected to the ends","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of the primary pp of a second induction coil. This primary pp has a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,small air gap ab.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The secondary s of this coil is provided with knobs or spheres KK of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the proper size and set at a distance suitable for the experiment.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,A long arc is established between the terminals AB of the first,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,induction coil. MM are the mica plates.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Each time the arc is broken between A and B the jars are quickly,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"charged and discharged through the primary pp, producing a snapping","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,spark between the knobs KK. Upon the arc forming between A and B the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"potential falls, and the jars cannot be charged to such high potential","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,as to break through the air gap ab until the arc is again broken by,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the draught.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"In this manner sudden impulses, at long intervals, are produced in the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"primary pp, which in the secondary s give a corresponding number of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"impulses of great intensity. If the secondary knobs or spheres, KK,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"are of the proper size, the sparks show much resemblance to those of a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Holtz machine.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"But these two effects, which to the eye appear so very different, are","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,only two of the many discharge phenomena. We only need to change the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"conditions of the test, and again we make other observations of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,interest.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"When, instead of operating the induction coil as in the last two","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"experiments, we operate it from a high frequency alternator, as in the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"next experiment, a systematic study of the phenomena is rendered much","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"more easy. In such case, in varying the strength and frequency of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"currents through the primary, we may observe five distinct forms of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"discharge, which I have described in my former paper on the subject[A]","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, May 20, 1891.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"[Footnote A: See THE ELECTRICAL WORLD, July 11, 1891.]","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"It would take too much time, and it would lead us too far from the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"subject presented this evening, to reproduce all these forms, but it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,seems to me desirable to show you one of them. It is a brush,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"discharge, which is interesting in more than one respect. Viewed from","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,a near position it resembles much a jet of gas escaping under great,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,pressure. We know that the phenomenon is due to the agitation of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"molecules near the terminal, and we anticipate that some heat must be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,developed by the impact of the molecules against the terminal or,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"against each other. Indeed, we find that the brush is hot, and only a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"little thought leads us to the conclusion that, could we but reach","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"sufficiently high frequencies, we could produce a brush which would","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"give intense light and heat, and which would resemble in every","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"particular an ordinary flame, save, perhaps, that both phenomena might","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"not be due to the same agent--save, perhaps, that chemical affinity","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,might not be _electrical_ in its nature.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,As the production of heat and light is here due to the impact of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"molecules, or atoms of air, or something else besides, and, as we can","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"augment the energy simply by raising the potential, we might, even","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"with frequencies obtained from a dynamo machine, intensify the action","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to such a degree as to bring the terminal to melting heat. But with,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,such low frequencies we would have to deal always with something of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the nature of an electric current. If I approach a conducting object,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to the brush, a thin little spark passes, yet, even with the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frequencies used this evening, the tendency to spark is not very","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"great. So, for instance, if I hold a metallic sphere at some distance","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,above the terminal you may see the whole space between the terminal,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and sphere illuminated by the streams without the spark passing; and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,with the much higher frequencies obtainable by the disruptive,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"discharge of a condenser, were it not for the sudden impulses, which","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"are comparatively few in number, sparking would not occur even at very","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"small distances. However, with incomparably higher frequencies, which","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"we may yet find means to produce efficiently, and provided that","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,electric impulses of such high frequencies could be transmitted,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"through a conductor, the electrical characteristics of the brush","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"discharge would completely vanish--no spark would pass, no shock would","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,be felt--yet we would still have to deal with an _electric_,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"phenomenon, but in the broad, modern interpretation of the word. In my","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,first paper before referred to I have pointed out the curious,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"properties of the brush, and described the best manner of producing","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"it, but I have thought it worth while to endeavor to express myself","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"more clearly in regard to this phenomenon, because of its absorbing","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,interest.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"When a coil is operated with currents of very high frequency,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"beautiful brush effects may be produced, even if the coil be of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,comparatively small dimensions. The experimenter may vary them in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"many ways, and, if it were nothing else, they afford a pleasing sight.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,What adds to their interest is that they may be produced with one,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"single terminal as well as with two--in fact, often better with one","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,than with two.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"But of all the discharge phenomena observed, the most pleasing to the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"eye, and the most instructive, are those observed with a coil which is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,operated by means of the disruptive discharge of a condenser. The,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"power of the brushes, the abundance of the sparks, when the conditions","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"are patiently adjusted, is often amazing. With even a very small coil,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,if it be so well insulated as to stand a difference of potential of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"several thousand volts per turn, the sparks may be so abundant that","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the whole coil may appear a complete mass of fire.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Curiously enough the sparks, when the terminals of the coil are set at","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"a considerable distance, seem to dart in every possible direction as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,though the terminals were perfectly independent of each other. As the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,sparks would soon destroy the insulation it is necessary to prevent,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,them. This is best done by immersing the coil in a good liquid,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"insulator, such as boiled-out oil. Immersion in a liquid may be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,considered almost an absolute necessity for the continued and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,successful working of such a coil.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"It is of course out of the question, in an experimental lecture, with","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"only a few minutes at disposal for the performance of each experiment,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to show these discharge phenomena to advantage, as to produce each","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,phenomenon at its best a very careful adjustment is required. But even,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"if imperfectly produced, as they are likely to be this evening, they","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,are sufficiently striking to interest an intelligent audience.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Before showing some of these curious effects I must, for the sake of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"completeness, give a short description of the coil and other apparatus","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,used in the experiments with the disruptive discharge this evening.,"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,"It is contained in a box B (Fig. 3) of thick boards of hard wood,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"covered on the outside with zinc sheet Z, which is carefully soldered","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"all around. It might be advisable, in a strictly scientific","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"investigation, when accuracy is of great importance, to do away with","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the metal cover, as it might introduce many errors, principally on","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"account of its complex action upon the coil, as a condenser of very","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,small capacity and as an electrostatic and electromagnetic screen.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"When the coil is used for such experiments as are here contemplated,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the employment of the metal cover offers some practical advantages,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,but these are not of sufficient importance to be dwelt upon.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The coil should be placed symmetrically to the metal cover, and the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"space between should, of course, not be too small, certainly not less","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"than, say, five centimetres, but much more if possible; especially the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"two sides of the zinc box, which are at right angles to the axis of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the coil, should be sufficiently remote from the latter, as otherwise","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,they might impair its action and be a source of loss.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The coil consists of two spools of hard rubber RR, held apart at a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"distance of 10 centimetres by bolts c and nuts n, likewise of hard","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,rubber. Each spool comprises a tube T of approximately 8 centimetres,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"inside diameter, and 3 millimetres thick, upon which are screwed two","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"flanges FF, 24 centimetres square, the space between the flanges being","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"about 3 centimetres. The secondary, SS, of the best gutta","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"percha-covered wire, has 26 layers, 10 turns in each, giving for each","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,half a total of 260 turns. The two halves are wound oppositely and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"connected in series, the connection between both being made over the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"primary. This disposition, besides being convenient, has the advantage","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"that when the coil is well balanced--that is, when both of its","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,terminals T_1 T_1 are connected to bodies or devices of equal,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"capacity--there is not much danger of breaking through to the primary,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and the insulation between the primary and the secondary need not be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,thick. In using the coil it is advisable to attach to _both_ terminals,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"devices of nearly equal capacity, as, when the capacity of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"terminals is not equal, sparks will be apt to pass to the primary. To","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"avoid this, the middle point of the secondary may be connected to the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"primary, but this is not always practicable.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The primary PP is wound in two parts, and oppositely, upon a wooden","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"spool W, and the four ends are led out of the oil through hard rubber","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,tubes tt. The ends of the secondary T_1 T_1 are also led out of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,oil through rubber tubes t_1 t_1 of great thickness. The primary and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"secondary layers are insulated by cotton cloth, the thickness of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"insulation, of course, bearing some proportion to the difference of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,potential between the turns of the different layers. Each half of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"primary has four layers, 24 turns in each, this giving a total of 96","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"turns. When both the parts are connected in series, this gives a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"ratio of conversion of about 1:2.7, and with the primaries in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"multiple, 1:5.4; but in operating with very rapidly alternating","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,currents this ratio does not convey even an approximate idea of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,ratio of the E.M.Fs. in the primary and secondary circuits. The coil,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is held in position in the oil on wooden supports, there being about 5","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,centimetres thickness of oil all round. Where the oil is not specially,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"needed, the space is filled with pieces of wood, and for this purpose","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,principally the wooden box B surrounding the whole is used.,"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,current are needed.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,In connection with the coil I use either the ordinary form of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,discharger or a modified form. In the former I have introduced two,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"changes which secure some advantages, and which are obvious. If they","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"are mentioned, it is only in the hope that some experimenter may find","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,them of use.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,[Illustration: FIG. 4.--ARRANGEMENT OF IMPROVED DISCHARGER AND,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,MAGNET.],"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"One of the changes is that the adjustable knobs A and B (Fig. 4),","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of the discharger are held in jaws of brass, JJ, by spring pressure,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"this allowing of turning them successively into different positions,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and so doing away with the tedious process of frequent polishing up.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The other change consists in the employment of a strong electromagnet,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"NS, which is placed with its axis at right angles to the line joining","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the knobs A and B, and produces a strong magnetic field between them.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The pole pieces of the magnet are movable and properly formed so as to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"protrude between the brass knobs, in order to make the field as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,intense as possible; but to prevent the discharge from jumping to the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"magnet the pole pieces are protected by a layer of mica, MM, of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,sufficient thickness. s_1 s_1 and s_2 s_2 are screws for fastening the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,wires. On each side one of the screws is for large and the other for,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"small wires. LL are screws for fixing in position the rods RR, which","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,support the knobs.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,In another arrangement with the magnet I take the discharge between,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the rounded pole pieces themselves, which in such case are insulated","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and preferably provided with polished brass caps.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The employment of an intense magnetic field is of advantage,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,principally when the induction coil or transformer which charges the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,condenser is operated by currents of very low frequency. In such a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,case the number of the fundamental discharges between the knobs may be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,so small as to render the currents produced in the secondary,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,unsuitable for many experiments. The intense magnetic field then,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"serves to blow out the arc between the knobs as soon as it is formed,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and the fundamental discharges occur in quicker succession.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Instead of the magnet, a draught or blast of air may be employed with","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,some advantage. In this case the arc is preferably established between,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the knobs AB, in Fig. 2 (the knobs ab being generally joined, or","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"entirely done away with), as in this disposition the arc is long and","Tesla, Nikola"

13476,The other form of discharger used in these and similar experiments is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,indicated in Figs. 6 and 7. It consists of a number of brass pieces cc,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"(Fig. 6), each of which comprises a spherical middle portion m with an","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,extension e below--which is merely used to fasten the piece in a lathe,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"when polishing up the discharging surface--and a column above, which","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,consists of a knurled flange f surmounted by a threaded stem l,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"carrying a nut n, by means of which a wire is fastened to the column.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The flange f conveniently serves for holding the brass piece when,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"fastening the wire, and also for turning it in any position when it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,becomes necessary to present a fresh discharging surface. Two stout,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"strips of hard rubber RR, with planed grooves gg (Fig. 7) to fit the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"middle portion of the pieces cc, serve to clamp the latter and hold","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,them firmly in position by means of two bolts CC (of which only one is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,shown) passing through the ends of the strips.,"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,[Illustration: FIG. 7.--DISCHARGER WITH MULTIPLE GAPS.],"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,In the use of this kind of discharger I have found three principal,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"advantages over the ordinary form. First, the dielectric strength of a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,given total width of air space is greater when a great many small air,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"gaps are used instead of one, which permits of working with a smaller","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"length of air gap, and that means smaller loss and less deterioration","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of the metal; secondly by reason of splitting the arc up into smaller,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"arcs, the polished surfaces are made to last much longer; and,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"thirdly, the apparatus affords some gauge in the experiments. I","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,usually set the pieces by putting between them sheets of uniform,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,thickness at a certain very small distance which is known from the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,experiments of Sir William Thomson to require a certain electromotive,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,force to be bridged by the spark.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"It should, of course, be remembered that the sparking distance is much","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,diminished as the frequency is increased. By taking any number of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"spaces the experimenter has a rough idea of the electromotive force,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and he finds it easier to repeat an experiment, as he has not the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,trouble of setting the knobs again and again. With this kind of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,discharger I have been able to maintain an oscillating motion without,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"any spark being visible with the naked eye between the knobs, and they","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,would not show a very appreciable rise in temperature. This form of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,discharge also lends itself to many arrangements of condensers and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,circuits which are often very convenient and time-saving. I have used,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"it preferably in a disposition similar to that indicated in Fig. 2,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,when the currents forming the arc are small.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,I may here mention that I have also used dischargers with single or,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"multiple air gaps, in which the discharge surfaces were rotated with","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"great speed. No particular advantage was, however, gained by this","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"method, except in cases where the currents from the condenser were","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"large and the keeping cool of the surfaces was necessary, and in cases","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"when, the discharge not being oscillating of itself, the arc as soon","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"as established was broken by the air current, thus starting the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,vibration at intervals in rapid succession. I have also used,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,mechanical interrupters in many ways. To avoid the difficulties with,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frictional contacts, the preferred plan adopted was to establish the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,arc and rotate through it at great speed a rim of mica provided with,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"many holes and fastened to a steel plate. It is understood, of course,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"that the employment of a magnet, air current, or other interrupter,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"produces no effect worth noticing, unless the self-induction, capacity","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and resistance are so related that there are oscillations set up upon,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,each interruption.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,I will now endeavor to show you some of the most noteworthy of these,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,discharge phenomena.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"I have stretched across the room two ordinary cotton covered wires,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,each about 7 metres in length. They are supported on insulating cords,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,at a distance of about 30 centimetres. I attach now to each of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,terminals of the coil one of the wires and set the coil in action.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Upon turning the lights off in the room you see the wires strongly,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,illuminated by the streams issuing abundantly from their whole surface,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in spite of the cotton covering, which may even be very thick. When","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the experiment is performed under good conditions, the light from the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,wires is sufficiently intense to allow distinguishing the objects in a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"room. To produce the best result it is, of course, necessary to adjust","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"carefully the capacity of the jars, the arc between the knobs and the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,length of the wires. My experience is that calculation of the length,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of the wires leads, in such case, to no result whatever. The","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"experimenter will do best to take the wires at the start very long,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and then adjust by cutting off first long pieces, and then smaller and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,smaller ones as he approaches the right length.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"A convenient way is to use an oil condenser of very small capacity,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"consisting of two small adjustable metal plates, in connection with","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,this and similar experiments. In such case I take wires rather short,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and set at the beginning the condenser plates at maximum distance. If,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the streams for the wires increase by approach of the plates, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,length of the wires is about right; if they diminish the wires are too,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,long for that frequency and potential. When a condenser is used in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"connection with experiments with such a coil, it should be an oil","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"condenser by all means, as in using an air condenser considerable","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,energy might be wasted. The wires leading to the plates in the oil,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"should be very thin, heavily coated with some insulating compound, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,provided with a conducting covering--this preferably extending under,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the surface of the oil. The conducting cover should not be too near,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the terminals, or ends, of the wire, as a spark would be apt to jump","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,from the wire to it. The conducting coating is used to diminish the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"air losses, in virtue of its action as an electrostatic screen. As to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the size of the vessel containing the oil, and the size of the plates,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the experimenter gains at once an idea from a rough trial. The size of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the plates _in oil_ is, however, calculable, as the dielectric losses","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,are very small.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,In the preceding experiment it is of considerable interest to know,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,what relation the quantity of the light emitted bears to the frequency,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and potential of the electric impulses. My opinion is that the heat as,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"well as light effects produced should be proportionate, under","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"otherwise equal conditions of test, to the product of frequency and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"square of potential, but the experimental verification of the law,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"whatever it may be, would be exceedingly difficult. One thing is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"certain, at any rate, and that is, that in augmenting the potential","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and frequency we rapidly intensify the streams; and, though it may be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"very sanguine, it is surely not altogether hopeless to expect that we","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,may succeed in producing a practical illuminant on these lines. We,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"would then be simply using burners or flames, in which there would be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"no chemical process, no consumption of material, but merely a transfer","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of energy, and which would, in all probability emit more light and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,less heat than ordinary flames.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,[Illustration: FIG. 8.--EFFECT PRODUCED BY CONCENTRATING STREAMS.],"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The luminous intensity of the streams is, of course, considerably","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,increased when they are focused upon a small surface. This may be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,shown by the following experiment:,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"I attach to one of the terminals of the coil a wire w (Fig. 8), bent","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in a circle of about 30 centimetres in diameter, and to the other","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"terminal I fasten a small brass sphere s, the surface of the wire","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"being preferably equal to the surface of the sphere, and the centre of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the latter being in a line at right angles to the plane of the wire,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,circle and passing through its centre. When the discharge is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"established under proper conditions, a luminous hollow cone is formed,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and in the dark one-half of the brass sphere is strongly illuminated,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,as shown in the cut.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"By some artifice or other, it is easy to concentrate the streams upon","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,small surfaces and to produce very strong light effects. Two thin,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,wires may thus be rendered intensely luminous.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,In order to intensify the streams the wires should be very thin and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,short; but as in this case their capacity would be generally too small,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"for the coil--at least, for such a one as the present--it is necessary","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to augment the capacity to the required value, while, at the same","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"time, the surface of the wires remains very small. This may be done in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,many ways.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Here, for instance, I have two plates, RR, of hard rubber (Fig. 9),","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"upon which I have glued two very thin wires ww, so as to form a name.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The wires may be bare or covered with the best insulation--it is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"immaterial for the success of the experiment. Well insulated wires, if","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"anything, are preferable. On the back of each plate, indicated by the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"shaded portion, is a tinfoil coating tt. The plates are placed in line","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,at a sufficient distance to prevent a spark passing from one to the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"other wire. The two tinfoil coatings I have joined by a conductor C,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and the two wires I presently connect to the terminals of the coil. It,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is now easy, by varying the strength and frequency of the currents","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"through the primary, to find a point at which, the capacity of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"system is best suited to the conditions, and the wires become so","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"strongly luminous that, when the light in the room is turned off the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,name formed by them appears in brilliant letters.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,[Illustration: FIG. 9.--WIRES RENDERED INTENSELY LUMINOUS.],"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,It is perhaps preferable to perform this experiment with a coil,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"operated from an alternator of high frequency, as then, owing to the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"harmonic rise and fall, the streams are very uniform, though they are","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,less abundant then when produced with such a coil as the present. This,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"experiment, however, may be performed with low frequencies, but much","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,less satisfactorily.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,[Illustration: FIG. 10.--LUMINOUS DISCS.],"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"When two wires, attached to the terminals of the coil, are set at the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"proper distance, the streams between them may be so intense as to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,produce a continuous luminous sheet. To show this phenomenon I have,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"here two circles, C and c (Fig. 10), of rather stout wire, one being","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,about 80 centimetres and the other 30 centimetres in diameter. To each,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of the terminals of the coil I attach one of the circles. The,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,supporting wires are so bent that the circles may be placed in the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"same plane, coinciding as nearly as possible. When the light in the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"room is turned off and the coil set to work, you see the whole space","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"between the wires uniformly filled with streams, forming a luminous","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"disc, which could be seen from a considerable distance, such is the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,intensity of the streams. The outer circle could have been much larger,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"than the present one; in fact, with this coil I have used much larger","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"circles, and I have been able to produce a strongly luminous sheet,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"covering an area of more than one square metre, which is a remarkable","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"effect with this very small coil. To avoid uncertainty, the circle has","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"been taken smaller, and the area is now about 0.43 square metre.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The frequency of the vibration, and the quickness of succession of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"sparks between the knobs, affect to a marked degree the appearance of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the streams. When the frequency is very low, the air gives way in more","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"or less the same manner, as by a steady difference of potential, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the streams consist of distinct threads, generally mingled with thin","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"sparks, which probably correspond to the successive discharges","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"occurring between the knobs. But when the frequency is extremely high,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and the arc of the discharge produces a very _loud_ but _smooth_,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,sound--showing both that oscillation takes place and that the sparks,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,succeed each other with great rapidity--then the luminous streams,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,formed are perfectly uniform. To reach this result very small coils,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and jars of small capacity should be used. I take two tubes of thick,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Bohemian glass, about 5 centimetres in diameter and 20 centimetres","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,long. In each of the tubes I slip a primary of very thick copper wire.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,On the top of each tube I wind a secondary of much thinner,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"gutta-percha covered wire. The two secondaries I connect in series,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the primaries preferably in multiple arc. The tubes are then placed in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"a large glass vessel, at a distance of 10 to 15 centimetres from each","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"other, on insulating supports, and the vessel is filled with boiled","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"out oil, the oil reaching about an inch above the tubes. The free ends","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of the secondary are lifted out of the oil and placed parallel to each,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,other at a distance of about 10 centimetres. The ends which are,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,scraped should be dipped in the oil. Two four-pint jars joined in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,series may be used to discharge through the primary. When the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,necessary adjustments in the length and distance of the wires above,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the oil and in the arc of discharge are made, a luminous sheet is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"produced between the wires which is perfectly smooth and textureless,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,like the ordinary discharge through a moderately exhausted tube.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,I have purposely dwelt upon this apparently insignificant experiment.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,In trials of this kind the experimenter arrives at the startling,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"conclusion that, to pass ordinary luminous discharges through gases,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"no particular degree of exhaustion is needed, but that the gas may be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"at ordinary or even greater pressure. To accomplish this, a very high","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frequency is essential; a high potential is likewise required, but","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,this is a merely incidental necessity. These experiments teach us,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"that, in endeavoring to discover novel methods of producing light by","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the agitation of atoms, or molecules, of a gas, we need not limit our","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"research to the vacuum tube, but may look forward quite seriously to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the possibility of obtaining the light effects without the use of any,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"vessel whatever, with air at ordinary pressure.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Such discharges of very high frequency, which render luminous the air","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"at ordinary pressures, we have probably often occasion to witness in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Nature. I have no doubt that if, as many believe, the aurora borealis","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is produced by sudden cosmic disturbances, such as eruptions at the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"sun's surface, which set the electrostatic charge of the earth in an","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"extremely rapid vibration, the red glow observed is not confined to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the upper rarefied strata of the air, but the discharge traverses, by","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"reason of its very high frequency, also the dense atmosphere in the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"form of a _glow_, such as we ordinarily produce in a slightly","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"exhausted tube. If the frequency were very low, or even more so, if","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the charge were not at all vibrating, the dense air would break down","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,as in a lightning discharge. Indications of such breaking down of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,lower dense strata of the air have been repeatedly observed at the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"occurrence of this marvelous phenomenon; but if it does occur, it can","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"only be attributed to the fundamental disturbances, which are few in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"number, for the vibration produced by them would be far too rapid to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,allow a disruptive break. It is the original and irregular impulses,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,which affect the instruments; the superimposed vibrations probably,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,pass unnoticed.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,When an ordinary low frequency discharge is passed through moderately,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"rarefied air, the air assumes a purplish hue. If by some means or","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"other we increase the intensity of the molecular, or atomic,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"vibration, the gas changes to a white color. A similar change occurs","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,at ordinary pressures with electric impulses of very high frequency.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"If the molecules of the air around a wire are moderately agitated, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,brush formed is reddish or violet; if the vibration is rendered,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"sufficiently intense, the streams become white. We may accomplish this","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,in various ways. In the experiment before shown with the two wires,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"across the room, I have endeavored to secure the result by pushing to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,a high value both the frequency and potential: in the experiment with,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the thin wires glued on the rubber plate I have concentrated the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"action upon a very small surface--in other words, I have worked with a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,great electric density.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,A most curious form of discharge is observed with such a coil when the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,frequency and potential are pushed to the extreme limit. To perform,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the experiment, every part of the coil should be heavily insulated,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and only two small spheres--or, better still, two sharp-edged metal","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"discs (dd, Fig. 11) of no more than a few centimetres in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,diameter--should be exposed to the air. The coil here used is immersed,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in oil, and the ends of the secondary reaching out of the oil are","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,covered with an air-tight cover of hard rubber of great thickness.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"All cracks, if there are any, should be carefully stopped up, so that","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the brush discharge cannot form anywhere except on the small spheres,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"or plates which are exposed to the air. In this case, since there are","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"no large plates or other bodies of capacity attached to the terminals,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the coil is capable of an extremely rapid vibration. The potential may,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"be raised by increasing, as far as the experimenter judges proper, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,rate of change of the primary current. With a coil not widely,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"differing from the present, it is best to connect the two primaries in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,multiple arc; but if the secondary should have a much greater number,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of turns the primaries should preferably be used in series, as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,otherwise the vibration might be too fast for the secondary. It occurs,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,under these conditions that misty white streams break forth from the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,edges of the discs and spread out phantom-like into space. With this,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"coil, when fairly well produced, they are about 25 to 30 centimetres","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"long. When the hand is held against them no sensation is produced, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"a spark, causing a shock, jumps from the terminal only upon the hand","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,being brought much nearer. If the oscillation of the primary current,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is rendered intermittent by some means or other, there is a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"corresponding throbbing of the streams, and now the hand or other","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,conducting object may be brought in still greater proximity to the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,terminal without a spark being caused to jump.,"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,coil I have here selected only those which appear to possess some,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"features of novelty, and lead us to some conclusions of interest. One","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"will not find it at all difficult to produce in the laboratory, by","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"means of it, many other phenomena which appeal to the eye even more","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"than these here shown, but present no particular feature of novelty.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Early experimenters describe the display of sparks produced by an,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,ordinary large induction coil upon an insulating plate separating the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,terminals. Quite recently Siemens performed some experiments in which,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"fine effects were obtained, which were seen by many with interest. No","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"doubt large coils, even if operated with currents of low frequencies,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,are capable of producing beautiful effects. But the largest coil ever,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"made could not, by far, equal the magnificent display of streams and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,sparks obtained from such a disruptive discharge coil when properly,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"adjusted. To give an idea, a coil such as the present one will cover","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,easily a plate of 1 metre in diameter completely with the streams. The,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,best way to perform such experiments is to take a very thin rubber or,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,a glass plate and glue on one side of it a narrow ring of tinfoil of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"very large diameter, and on the other a circular washer, the centre of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the latter coinciding with that of the ring, and the surfaces of both","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"being preferably equal, so as to keep the coil well balanced. The","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,washer and ring should be connected to the terminals by heavily,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,insulated thin wires. It is easy in observing the effect of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"capacity to produce a sheet of uniform streams, or a fine network of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"thin silvery threads, or a mass of loud brilliant sparks, which","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,completely cover the plate.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Since I have advanced the idea of the conversion by means of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"disruptive discharge, in my paper before the American Institute of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Electrical Engineers at the beginning of the past year, the interest","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,excited in it has been considerable. It affords us a means for,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,producing any potentials by the aid of inexpensive coils operated from,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"ordinary systems of distribution, and--what is perhaps more","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,appreciated--it enables us to convert currents of any frequency into,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,currents of any other lower or higher frequency. But its chief value,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,will perhaps be found in the help which it will afford us in the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"investigations of the phenomena of phosphorescence, which a disruptive","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,discharge coil is capable of exciting in innumerable cases where,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"ordinary coils, even the largest, would utterly fail.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Considering its probable uses for many practical purposes, and its","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"possible introduction into laboratories for scientific research, a few","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,additional remarks as to the construction of such a coil will perhaps,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,not be found superfluous.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"It is, of course, absolutely necessary to employ in such a coil wires","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,provided with the best insulation.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Good coils may be produced by employing wires covered with several,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"layers of cotton, boiling the coil a long time in pure wax, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,cooling under moderate pressure. The advantage of such a coil is that,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"it can be easily handled, but it cannot probably give as satisfactory","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"results as a coil immersed in pure oil. Besides, it seems that the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"presence of a large body of wax affects the coil disadvantageously,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,whereas this does not seem to be the case with oil. Perhaps it is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,because the dielectric losses in the liquid are smaller.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,I have tried at first silk and cotton covered wires with oil,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"immersion, but I have been gradually led to use gutta-percha covered","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"wires, which proved most satisfactory. Gutta-percha insulation adds,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of course, to the capacity of the coil, and this, especially if the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"coil be large, is a great disadvantage when extreme frequencies are","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"desired; but on the other hand, gutta-percha will withstand much more","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"than an equal thickness of oil, and this advantage should be secured","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"at any price. Once the coil has been immersed, it should never be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"taken out of the oil for more than a few hours, else the gutta-percha","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,will crack up and the coil will not be worth half as much as before.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Gutta-percha is probably slowly attacked by the oil, but after an","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,immersion of eight to nine months I have found no ill effects.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,I have obtained in commerce two kinds of gutta-percha wire: in one the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"insulation sticks tightly to the metal, in the other it does not.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Unless a special method is followed to expel all air, it is much safer","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to use the first kind. I wind the coil within an oil tank so that all,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,interstices are filled up with the oil. Between the layers I use cloth,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"boiled out thoroughly in oil, calculating the thickness according to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the difference of potential between the turns. There seems not to be a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,very great difference whatever kind of oil is used; I use paraffine or,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,linseed oil.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"To exclude more perfectly the air, an excellent way to proceed, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"easily practicable with small coils, is the following: Construct a box","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of hard wood of very thick boards which have been for a long time,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,boiled in oil. The boards should be so joined as to safely withstand,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the external air pressure. The coil being placed and fastened in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"position within the box, the latter is closed with a strong lid, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"covered with closely fitting metal sheets, the joints of which are","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"soldered very carefully. On the top two small holes are drilled,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"passing through the metal sheet and the wood, and in these holes two","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,small glass tubes are inserted and the joints made air-tight. One of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the tubes is connected to a vacuum pump, and the other with a vessel","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,containing a sufficient quantity of boiled-out oil. The latter tube,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"has a very small hole at the bottom, and is provided with a stopcock.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"When a fairly good vacuum has been obtained, the stopcock is opened","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and the oil slowly fed in. Proceeding in this manner, it is impossible","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"that any big bubbles, which are the principal danger, should remain","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"between the turns. The air is most completely excluded, probably","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"better than by boiling out, which, however, when gutta-percha coated","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"wires are used, is not practicable.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,For the primaries I use ordinary line wire with a thick cotton,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,coating. Strands of very thin insulated wires properly interlaced,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"would, of course, be the best to employ for the primaries, but they","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,are not to be had.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,In an experimental coil the size of the wires is not of great,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,importance. In the coil here used the primary is No. 12 and the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,secondary No. 24 Brown & Sharpe gauge wire; but the sections may be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,varied considerably. It would only imply different adjustments; the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,results aimed at would not be materially affected.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,I have dwelt at some length upon the various forms of brush discharge,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"because, in studying them, we not only observe phenomena which please","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"our eye, but also afford us food for thought, and lead us to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,conclusions of practical importance. In the use of alternating,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"currents of very high tension, too much precaution cannot be taken to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"prevent the brush discharge. In a main conveying such currents, in an","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"induction coil or transformer, or in a condenser, the brush discharge","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,is a source of great danger to the insulation. In a condenser,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"especially the gaseous matter must be most carefully expelled, for in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"it the charged surfaces are near each other, and if the potentials are","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"high, just as sure as a weight will fall if let go, so the insulation","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"will give way if a single gaseous bubble of some size be present,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"whereas, if all gaseous matter were carefully excluded, the condenser","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,would safely withstand a much higher difference of potential. A main,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,conveying alternating currents of very high tension may be injured,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"merely by a blow hole or small crack in the insulation, the more so as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,a blowhole is apt to contain gas at low pressure; and as it appears,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"almost impossible to completely obviate such little imperfections, I","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,am led to believe that in our future distribution of electrical energy,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,by currents of very high tension liquid insulation will be used. The,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"cost is a great drawback, but if we employ an oil as an insulator the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"distribution of electrical energy with something like 100,000 volts,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and even more, become, at least with higher frequencies, so easy that","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,they could be hardly called engineering feats. With oil insulation,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and alternate current motors transmissions of power can be effected,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,with safety and upon an industrial basis at distances of as much as a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,thousand miles.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"A peculiar property of oils, and liquid insulation in general, when","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"subjected to rapidly changing electric stresses, is to disperse any","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"gaseous bubbles which may be present, and diffuse them through its","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"mass, generally long before any injurious break can occur. This","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,feature may be easily observed with an ordinary induction coil by,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"taking the primary out, plugging up the end of the tube upon which the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"secondary is wound, and filling it with some fairly transparent","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"insulator, such as paraffine oil. A primary of a diameter something","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,like six millimetres smaller than the inside of the tube may be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"inserted in the oil. When the coil is set to work one may see, looking","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"from the top through the oil, many luminous points--air bubbles which","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"are caught by inserting the primary, and which are rendered luminous","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in consequence of the violent bombardment. The occluded air, by its","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"impact against the oil, heats it; the oil begins to circulate,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"carrying some of the air along with it, until the bubbles are","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"dispersed and the luminous points disappear. In this manner, unless","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,large bubbles are occluded in such way that circulation is rendered,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"impossible, a damaging break is averted, the only effect being a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"moderate warming up of the oil. If, instead of the liquid, a solid","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"insulation, no matter how thick, were used, a breaking through and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,injury of the apparatus would be inevitable.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The exclusion of gaseous matter from any apparatus in which the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,dielectric is subjected to more or less rapidly changing electric,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"forces is, however, not only desirable in order to avoid a possible","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"injury of the apparatus, but also on account of economy. In a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"condenser, for instance, as long as only a solid or only a liquid","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"dielectric is used, the loss is small; but if a gas under ordinary or","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,small pressure be present the loss may be very great. Whatever the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"nature of the force acting in the dielectric may be, it seems that in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,a solid or liquid the molecular displacement produced by the force is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"small; hence the product of force and displacement is insignificant,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"unless the force be very great; but in a gas the displacement, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"therefore this product, is considerable; the molecules are free to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"move, they reach high speeds, and the energy of their impact is lost","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in heat or otherwise. If the gas be strongly compressed, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"displacement due to the force is made smaller, and the losses are","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,reduced.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"In most of the succeeding experiments I prefer, chiefly on account of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the regular and positive action, to employ the alternator before","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,referred to. This is one of the several machines constructed by me for,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the purposes of these investigations. It has 384 pole projections, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is capable of giving currents of a frequency of about 10,000 per","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,second. This machine has been illustrated and briefly described in my,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"first paper before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, May","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"20, 1891, to which I have already referred. A more detailed","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"description, sufficient to enable any engineer to build a similar","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"machine, will be found in several electrical journals of that period.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The induction coils operated from the machine are rather small,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"containing from 5,000 to 15,000 turns in the secondary. They are","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"immersed in boiled-out linseed oil, contained in wooden boxes covered","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,with zinc sheet.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,I have found it advantageous to reverse the usual position of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"wires, and to wind, in these coils, the primaries on the top; this","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"allowing the use of a much bigger primary, which, of course, reduces","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the danger of overheating and increases the output of the coil. I make,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the primary on each side at least one centimetre shorter than the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"secondary, to prevent the breaking through on the ends, which would","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,surely occur unless the insulation on the top of the secondary be very,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"thick, and this, of course, would be disadvantageous.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"When the primary is made movable, which is necessary in some","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"experiments, and many times convenient for the purposes of adjustment,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"I cover the secondary with wax, and turn it off in a lathe to a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,diameter slightly smaller than the inside of the primary coil. The,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"latter I provide with a handle reaching out of the oil, which serves","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to shift it in any position along the secondary.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"I will now venture to make, in regard to the general manipulation of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"induction coils, a few observations bearing upon points which have not","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"been fully appreciated in earlier experiments with such coils, and are","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,even now often overlooked.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The secondary of the coil possesses usually such a high self-induction,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"that the current through the wire is inappreciable, and may be so even","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,when the terminals are joined by a conductor of small resistance. If,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"capacity is added to the terminals, the self-induction is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"counteracted, and a stronger current is made to flow through the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"secondary, though its terminals are insulated from each other. To one","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,entirely unacquainted with the properties of alternating currents,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,nothing will look more puzzling. This feature was illustrated in the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,experiment performed at the beginning with the top plates of wire,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,gauze attached to the terminals and the rubber plate. When the plates,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of wire gauze were close together, and a small arc passed between","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"them, the arc _prevented_ a strong current from passing through the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"secondary, because it did away with the capacity on the terminals;","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"when the rubber plate was inserted between, the capacity of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"condenser formed counteracted the self-induction of the secondary, a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"stronger current passed now, the coil performed more work, and the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,discharge was by far more powerful.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The first thing, then, in operating the induction coil is to combine","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,capacity with the secondary to overcome the self-induction. If the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,frequencies and potentials are very high gaseous matter should be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,carefully kept away from the charged surfaces. If Leyden jars are,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"used, they should be immersed in oil, as otherwise considerable","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,dissipation may occur if the jars are greatly strained. When high,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frequencies are used, it is of equal importance to combine a condenser","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,with the primary. One may use a condenser connected to the ends of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"primary or to the terminals of the alternator, but the latter is not","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to be recommended, as the machine might be injured. The best way is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,undoubtedly to use the condenser in series with the primary and with,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the alternator, and to adjust its capacity so as to annul the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,self-induction of both the latter. The condenser should be adjustable,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"by very small steps, and for a finer adjustment a small oil condenser","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,with movable plates may be used conveniently.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"I think it best at this juncture to bring before you a phenomenon,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"observed by me some time ago, which to the purely scientific","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,investigator may perhaps appear more interesting than any of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,results which I have the privilege to present to you this evening.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"It may be quite properly ranked among the brush phenomena--in fact, it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is a brush, formed at, or near, a single terminal in high vacuum.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"In bulbs provided with a conducting terminal, though it be of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"aluminium, the brush has but an ephemeral existence, and cannot,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"unfortunately, be indefinitely preserved in its most sensitive state,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,even in a bulb devoid of any conducting electrode. In studying the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"phenomenon, by all means a bulb having no leading-in wire should be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,used. I have found it best to use bulbs constructed as indicated in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Figs. 12 and 13.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"In Fig. 12 the bulb comprises an incandescent lamp globe L, in the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"neck of which is sealed a barometer tube b, the end of which is blown","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,out to form a small sphere s. This sphere should be sealed as closely,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"as possible in the centre of the large globe. Before sealing, a thin","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"tube t, of aluminium sheet, may be slipped in the barometer tube, but","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,it is not important to employ it.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The small hollow sphere s is filled with some conducting powder, and a","Tesla, Nikola"

13476,The construction shown in Fig. 13 was chosen in order to remove from,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the brush any conducting body which might possibly affect it. The bulb,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"consists in this case of a lamp globe L, which has a neck n, provided","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"with a tube b and small sphere s, sealed to it, so that two entirely","Tesla, Nikola"

13476,moderately rarefied and highly conducting gas inclosed in the neck.,"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,"It is of advantage to make the tube t very thick, the hole through it","Tesla, Nikola"

13476,[Illustration: FIG. 14.--FORMS AND PHASES OF THE ROTATING BRUSH.],"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,"Figs. 14, 15 and 16 indicate different forms, or stages, of the brush.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Fig. 14 shows the brush as it first appears in a bulb provided with a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"conducting terminal; but, as in such a bulb it very soon","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,disappears--often after a few minutes--I will confine myself to the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,description of the phenomenon as seen in a bulb without conducting,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,electrode. It is observed under the following conditions:,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,When the globe L (Figs. 12 and 13) is exhausted to a very high,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"degree, generally the bulb is not excited upon connecting the wire w","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,(Fig. 12) or the tinfoil coating of the bulb (Fig. 13) to the terminal,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of the induction coil. To excite it, it is usually sufficient to grasp","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the globe L with the hand. An intense phosphorescence then spreads at,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"first over the globe, but soon gives place to a white, misty light.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Shortly afterward one may notice that the luminosity is unevenly,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"distributed in the globe, and after passing the current for some time","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the bulb appears as in Fig. 15. From this stage the phenomenon will,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"gradually pass to that indicated in Fig. 16, after some minutes,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"hours, days or weeks, according as the bulb is worked. Warming the","Tesla, Nikola"

13476,"When the brush assumes the form indicated in Fig. 16, it maybe brought","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to a state of extreme sensitiveness to electrostatic and magnetic,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"influence. The bulb hanging straight down from a wire, and all objects","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"being remote from it, the approach of the observer at a few paces from","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the bulb will cause the brush to fly to the opposite side, and if he","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,walks around the bulb it will always keep on the opposite side. It may,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,begin to spin around the terminal long before it reaches that,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"sensitive stage. When it begins to turn around principally, but also","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"before, it is affected by a magnet, and at a certain stage it is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,susceptible to magnetic influence to an astonishing degree. A small,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"permanent magnet, with its poles at a distance of no more than two","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"centimetres, will affect it visibly at a distance of two metres,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,slowing down or accelerating the rotation according to how it is held,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,relatively to the brush. I think I have observed that at the stage,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"when it is most sensitive to magnetic, it is not most sensitive to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"electrostatic, influence. My explanation is, that the electrostatic","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"attraction between the brush and the glass of the bulb, which retards","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the rotation, grows much quicker than the magnetic influence when the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,intensity of the stream is increased.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"When the bulb hangs with the globe L down, the rotation is always","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,clockwise. In the southern hemisphere it would occur in the opposite,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,direction and on the equator the brush should not turn at all. The,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,rotation may be reversed by a magnet kept at some distance. The brush,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"rotates best, seemingly, when it is at right angles to the lines of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"force of the earth. It very likely rotates, when at its maximum speed,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in synchronism with the alternations, say 10,000 times a second. The","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,rotation can be slowed down or accelerated by the approach or receding,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of the observer, or any conducting body, but it cannot be reversed by","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,putting the bulb in any position. When it is in the state of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,highest sensitiveness and the potential or frequency be varied the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,sensitiveness is rapidly diminished. Changing either of these but,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,little will generally stop the rotation. The sensitiveness is likewise,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,affected by the variations of temperature. To attain great,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,sensitiveness it is necessary to have the small sphere s in the centre,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of the globe L, as otherwise the electrostatic action of the glass of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the globe will tend to stop the rotation. The sphere s should be small,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and of uniform thickness; any dissymmetry of course has the effect to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,diminish the sensitiveness.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The fact that the brush rotates in a definite direction in a permanent,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,magnetic field seems to show that in alternating currents of very high,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frequency the positive and negative impulses are not equal, but that","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,one always preponderates over the other.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Of course, this rotation in one direction may be due to the action of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"two elements of the same current upon each other, or to the action of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the field produced by one of the elements upon the other, as in a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"series motor, without necessarily one impulse being stronger than the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"other. The fact that the brush turns, as far as I could observe, in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"any position, would speak for this view. In such case it would turn","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"at any point of the earth's surface. But, on the other hand, it is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,then hard to explain why a permanent magnet should reverse the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"rotation, and one must assume the preponderance of impulses of one","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,kind.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"As to the causes of the formation of the brush or stream, I think it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,is due to the electrostatic action of the globe and the dissymmetry of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the parts. If the small bulb s and the globe L were perfect concentric,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"spheres, and the glass throughout of the same thickness and quality, I","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"think the brush would not form, as the tendency to pass would be equal","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,on all sides. That the formation of the stream is due to an,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,irregularity is apparent from the fact that it has the tendency to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"remain in one position, and rotation occurs most generally only when","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,it is brought out of this position by electrostatic or magnetic,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,influence. When in an extremely sensitive state it rests in one,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"position, most curious experiments may be performed with it. For","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"instance, the experimenter may, by selecting a proper position,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"approach the hand at a certain considerable distance to the bulb, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,he may cause the brush to pass off by merely stiffening the muscles of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the arm. When it begins to rotate slowly, and the hands are held at a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"proper distance, it is impossible to make even the slightest motion","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,without producing a visible effect upon the brush. A metal plate,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,connected to the other terminal of the coil affects it at a great,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"distance, slowing down the rotation often to one turn a second.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"I am firmly convinced that such a brush, when we learn how to produce","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"it properly, will prove a valuable aid in the investigation of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,nature of the forces acting in an electrostatic or magnetic field. If,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"there is any motion which is measurable going on in the space, such a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"brush ought to reveal it. It is, so to speak, a beam of light,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frictionless, devoid of inertia.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,I think that it may find practical applications in telegraphy. With,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,such a brush it would be possible to send dispatches across the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Atlantic, for instance, with any speed, since its sensitiveness may be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,so great that the slightest changes will affect it. If it were,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"possible to make the stream more intense and very narrow, its","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,deflections could be easily photographed.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,I have been interested to find whether there is a rotation of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"stream itself, or whether there is simply a stress traveling around in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the bulb. For this purpose I mounted a light mica fan so that its,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,vanes were in the path of the brush. If the stream itself was rotating,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the fan would be spun around. I could produce no distinct rotation of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the fan, although I tried the experiment repeatedly; but as the fan","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"exerted a noticeable influence on the stream, and the apparent","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"rotation of the latter was, in this case, never quite satisfactory,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the experiment did not appear to be conclusive.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,I have been unable to produce the phenomenon with the disruptive,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"discharge coil, although every other of these phenomena can be well","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"produced by it--many, in fact, much better than with coils operated","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,from an alternator.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"It may be possible to produce the brush by impulses of one direction,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"or even by a steady potential, in which case it would be still more","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,sensitive to magnetic influence.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"In operating an induction coil with rapidly alternating currents, we","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"realize with astonishment, for the first time, the great importance","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of the relation of capacity, self-induction and frequency as regards","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the general result. The effects of capacity are the most striking, for","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in these experiments, since the self-induction and frequency both are","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"high, the critical capacity is very small, and need be but slightly","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,varied to produce a very considerable change. The experimenter may,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,bring his body in contact with the terminals of the secondary of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"coil, or attach to one or both terminals insulated bodies of very","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"small bulk, such as bulbs, and he may produce a considerable rise or","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"fall of potential, and greatly affect the flow of the current through","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the primary. In the experiment before shown, in which a brush appears","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"at a wire attached to one terminal, and the wire is vibrated when the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,experimenter brings his insulated body in contact with the other,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"terminal of the coil, the sudden rise of potential was made evident.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,I may show you the behavior of the coil in another manner which,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,possesses a feature of some interest. I have here a little light fan,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of aluminium sheet, fastened to a needle and arranged to rotate freely","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,in a metal piece screwed to one of the terminals of the coil. When the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"coil is set to work, the molecules of the air are rhythmically","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,attracted and repelled. As the force with which they are repelled is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"greater than that with which they are attracted, it results that there","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,is a repulsion exerted on the surfaces of the fan. If the fan were,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"made simply of a metal sheet, the repulsion would be equal on the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"opposite sides, and would produce no effect. But if one of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"opposing surfaces is screened, or if, generally speaking, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"bombardment on this side is weakened in some way or other, there","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"remains the repulsion exerted upon the other, and the fan is set in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,rotation. The screening is best effected by fastening upon one of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"opposing sides of the fan insulated conducting coatings, or, if the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"fan is made in the shape of an ordinary propeller screw, by fastening","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"on one side, and close to it, an insulated metal plate. The static","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"screen may, however, be omitted, and simply a thickness of insulating","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,material fastened to one of the sides of the fan.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"To show the behavior of the coil, the fan may be placed upon the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,terminal and it will readily rotate when the coil is operated by,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"currents of very high frequency. With a steady potential, of course,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and even with alternating currents of very low frequency, it would not","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"turn, because of the very slow exchange of air and, consequently,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,smaller bombardment; but in the latter case it might turn if the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"potential were excessive. With a pin wheel, quite the opposite rule","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"holds good; it rotates best with a steady potential, and the effort is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the smaller the higher the frequency. Now, it is very easy to adjust","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the conditions so that the potential is normally not sufficient to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"turn the fan, but that by connecting the other terminal of the coil","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"with an insulated body it rises to a much greater value, so as to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"rotate the fan, and it is likewise possible to stop the rotation by","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"connecting to the terminal a body of different size, thereby","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,diminishing the potential.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Instead of using the fan in this experiment, we may use the ""electric""","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,radiometer with similar effect. But in this case it will be found that,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the vanes will rotate only at high exhaustion or at ordinary,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"pressures; they will not rotate at moderate pressures, when the air is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,highly conducting. This curious observation was made conjointly by,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Professor Crookes and myself. I attribute the result to the high,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"conductivity of the air, the molecules of which then do not act as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"independent carriers of electric charges, but act all together as a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"single conducting body. In such case, of course, if there is any","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"repulsion at all of the molecules from the vanes, it must be very","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"small. It is possible, however, that the result is in part due to the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,fact that the greater part of the discharge passes from the leading-in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"wire through the highly conducting gas, instead of passing off from","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the conducting vanes.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,In trying the preceding experiment with the electric radiometer the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"potential should not exceed a certain limit, as then the electrostatic","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,attraction between the vanes and the glass of the bulb may be so great,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,as to stop the rotation.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,A most curious feature of alternate currents of high frequencies and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,potentials is that they enable us to perform many experiments by the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,use of one wire only. In many respects this feature is of great,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,interest.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,In a type of alternate current motor invented by me some years ago I,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"produced rotation by inducing, by means of a single alternating","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"current passed through a motor circuit, in the mass or other circuits","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of the motor, secondary currents, which, jointly with the primary or","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"inducing current, created a moving field of force. A simple but crude","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,form of such a motor is obtained by winding upon an iron core a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"primary, and close to it a secondary coil, joining the ends of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,latter and placing a freely movable metal disc within the influence of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the field produced by both. The iron core is employed for obvious,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"reasons, but it is not essential to the operation. To improve the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"motor, the iron core is made to encircle the armature. Again to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"improve, the secondary coil is made to overlap partly the primary, so","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,that it cannot free itself from a strong inductive action of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"latter, repel its lines as it may. Once more to improve, the proper","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,difference of phase is obtained between the primary and secondary,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"currents by a condenser, self-induction, resistance or equivalent","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,windings.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"I had discovered, however, that rotation is produced by means of a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"single coil and core; my explanation of the phenomenon, and leading","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"thought in trying the experiment, being that there must be a true time","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,lag in the magnetization of the core. I remember the pleasure I had,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"when, in the writings of Professor Ayrton, which came later to my","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"hand, I found the idea of the time lag advocated. Whether there is a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"true time lag, or whether the retardation is due to eddy currents","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"circulating in minute paths, must remain an open question, but the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,fact is that a coil wound upon an iron core and traversed by an,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"alternating current creates a moving field of force, capable of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"setting an armature in rotation. It is of some interest, in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"conjunction with the historical Arago experiment, to mention that in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,lag or phase motors I have produced rotation in the opposite direction,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to the moving field, which means that in that experiment the magnet","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"may not rotate, or may even rotate in the opposite direction to the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"moving disc. Here, then, is a motor (diagrammatically illustrated in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Fig. 17), comprising a coil and iron core, and a freely movable copper","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,disc in proximity to the latter.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"[Illustration: FIG. 17.--SINGLE WIRE AND ""NO-WIRE"" MOTOR.]","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"To demonstrate a novel and interesting feature, I have, for a reason","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"which I will explain, selected this type of motor. When the ends of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the coil are connected to the terminals of an alternator the disc is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"set in rotation. But it is not this experiment, now well known, which","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,I desire to perform. What I wish to show you is that this motor,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,rotates with _one single_ connection between it and the generator;,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"that is to say, one terminal of the motor is connected to one terminal","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of the generator--in this case the secondary of a high-tension,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,induction coil--the other terminals of motor and generator being,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,insulated in space. To produce rotation it is generally (but not,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,absolutely) necessary to connect the free end of the motor coil to an,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,insulated body of some size. The experimenter's body is more than,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,sufficient. If he touches the free terminal with an object held in the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"hand, a current passes through the coil and the copper disc is set in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"rotation. If an exhausted tube is put in series with the coil, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"tube lights brilliantly, showing the passage of a strong current.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Instead of the experimenter's body, a small metal sheet suspended on a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,cord may be used with the same result. In this case the plate acts as,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,a condenser in series with the coil. It counteracts the self-induction,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of the latter and allows a strong current to pass. In such a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"combination, the greater the self-induction of the coil the smaller","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"need be the plate, and this means that a lower frequency, or","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"eventually a lower potential, is required to operate the motor. A","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,single coil wound upon a core has a high self-induction; for this,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"reason principally, this type of motor was chosen to perform the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"experiment. Were a secondary closed coil wound upon the core, it would","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"tend to diminish the self-induction, and then it would be necessary to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,employ a much higher frequency and potential. Neither would be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"advisable, for a higher potential would endanger the insulation of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"small primary coil, and a higher frequency would result in a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,materially diminished torque.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,It should be remarked that when such a motor with a closed secondary,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is used, it is not at all easy to obtain rotation with excessive","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frequencies, as the secondary cuts off almost completely the lines of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the primary--and this, of course, the more, the higher the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,frequency--and allows the passage of but a minute current. In such a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"case, unless the secondary is closed through a condenser, it is almost","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"essential, in order to produce rotation, to make the primary and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,secondary coils overlap each other more or less.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"But there is an additional feature of interest about this motor,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"namely, it is not necessary to have even a single connection between","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the motor and generator, except, perhaps, through the ground: for not","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"only is an insulated plate capable of giving off energy into space,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,but it is likewise capable of deriving it from an alternating,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"electrostatic field, though in the latter case the available energy is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,much smaller. In this instance one of the motor terminals is connected,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to the insulated plate or body located within the alternating,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"electrostatic field, and the other terminal preferably to the ground.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"It is quite possible, however, that such ""no-wire"" motors, as they","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"might be called, could be operated by conduction through the rarefied","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"air at considerable distances. Alternate currents, especially of high","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frequencies, pass with astonishing freedom through even slightly","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,rarefied gases. The upper strata of the air are rarefied. To reach a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,number of miles out into space requires the overcoming of difficulties,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of a merely mechanical nature. There is no doubt that with the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,enormous potentials obtainable by the use of high frequencies and oil,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,insulation luminous discharges might be passed through many miles of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"rarefied air, and that, by thus directing the energy of many hundreds","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"or thousands of horse-power, motors or lamps might be operated at","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,considerable distances from stationary sources. But such schemes are,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,mentioned merely as possibilities. We shall have no need to transmit,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,power in this way. We shall have no need to _transmit_ power at all.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Ere many generations pass, our machinery will be driven by a power","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,obtainable at any point of the universe. This idea is not novel. Men,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,have been led to it long ago by instinct or reason. It has been,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"expressed in many ways, and in many places, in the history of old and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"new. We find it in the delightful myth of Antheus, who derives power","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,from the earth; we find it among the subtile speculations of one of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"your splendid mathematicians, and in many hints and statements of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,thinkers of the present time. Throughout space there is energy. Is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,this energy static or kinetic? If static our hopes are in vain; if,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"kinetic--and this we know it is, for certain--then it is a mere","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,question of time when men will succeed in attaching their machinery to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the very wheelwork of nature. Of all, living or dead, Crookes came","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,nearest to doing it. His radiometer will turn in the light of day and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,in the darkness of the night; it will turn everywhere where there is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"heat, and heat is everywhere. But, unfortunately, this beautiful","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"little machine, while it goes down to posterity as the most","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"interesting, must likewise be put on record as the most inefficient","Tesla, Nikola"

13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The preceding experiment is only one of many equally interesting,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,experiments which may be performed by the use of only one wire with,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,alternate currents of high potential and frequency. We may connect an,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"insulated line to a source of such currents, we may pass an","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"inappreciable current over the line, and on any point of the same we","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"are able to obtain a heavy current, capable of fusing a thick copper","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"wire. Or we may, by the help of some artifice, decompose a solution in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,any electrolytic cell by connecting only one pole of the cell to the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"line or source of energy. Or we may, by attaching to the line, or only","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"bringing into its vicinity, light up an incandescent lamp, an","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"exhausted tube, or a phosphorescent bulb.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"However impracticable this plan of working may appear in many cases,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"it certainly seems practicable, and even recommendable, in the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"production of light. A perfected lamp would require but little energy,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and if wires were used at all we ought to be able to supply that,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,energy without a return wire.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,It is now a fact that a body may be rendered incandescent or,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,phosphorescent by bringing it either in single contact or merely in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the vicinity of a source of electric impulses of the proper character,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and that in this manner a quantity of light sufficient to afford a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"practical illuminant may be produced. It is, therefore, to say the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"least, worth while to attempt to determine the best conditions and to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,invent the best appliances for attaining this object.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Some experiences have already been gained in this direction, and I","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"will dwell on them briefly, in the hope that they might prove useful.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The heating of a conducting body inclosed in a bulb, and connected to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"a source of rapidly alternating electric impulses, is dependent on so","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"many things of a different nature, that it would be difficult to give","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,a generally applicable rule under which the maximum heating occurs. As,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"regards the size of the vessel, I have lately found that at ordinary","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"or only slightly differing atmospheric pressures, when air is a good","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"insulator, and hence practically the same amount of energy by a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"certain potential and frequency is given off from the body, whether","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the bulb be small or large, the body is brought to a higher","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"temperature if inclosed in a small bulb, because of the better","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,confinement of heat in this case.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"At lower pressures, when air becomes more or less conducting, or if","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the air be sufficiently warmed as to become conducting, the body is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"rendered more intensely incandescent in a large bulb, obviously","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"because, under otherwise equal conditions of test, more energy may be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,given off from the body when the bulb is large.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"At very high degrees of exhaustion, when the matter in the bulb","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"becomes ""radiant,"" a large bulb has still an advantage, but a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"comparatively slight one, over the small bulb.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Finally, at excessively high degrees of exhaustion, which cannot be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"reached except by the employment of special means, there seems to be,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"beyond a certain and rather small size of vessel, no perceptible","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,difference in the heating.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"These observations were the result of a number of experiments, of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"which one, showing the effect of the size of the bulb at a high degree","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of exhaustion, may be described and shown here, as it presents a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"feature of interest. Three spherical bulbs of 2 inches, 3 inches and 4","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"inches diameter were taken, and in the centre of each was mounted an","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,equal length of an ordinary incandescent lamp filament of uniform,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,thickness. In each bulb the piece of filament was fastened to the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"leading-in wire of platinum, contained in a glass stem sealed in the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"bulb; care being taken, of course, to make everything as nearly alike","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,as possible. On each glass stem in the inside of the bulb was slipped,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"a highly polished tube made of aluminium sheet, which fitted the stem","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and was held on it by spring pressure. The function of this aluminium,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,tube will be explained subsequently. In each bulb an equal length of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,filament protruded above the metal tube. It is sufficient to say now,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,that under these conditions equal lengths of filament of the same,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"thickness--in other words, bodies of equal bulk--were brought to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"incandescence. The three bulbs were sealed to a glass tube, which was","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"connected to a Sprengel pump. When a high vacuum had been reached, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,glass tube carrying the bulbs was sealed off. A current was then,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"turned on successively on each bulb, and it was found that the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"filaments came to about the same brightness, and, if anything, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"smallest bulb, which was placed midway between the two larger ones,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"may have been slightly brighter. This result was expected, for when","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,either of the bulbs was connected to the coil the luminosity spread,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"through the other two, hence the three bulbs constituted really one","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,vessel. When all the three bulbs were connected in multiple arc to the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"coil, in the largest of them the filament glowed brightest, in the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"next smaller it was a little less bright, and in the smallest it only","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,came to redness. The bulbs were then sealed off and separately tried.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The brightness of the filaments was now such as would have been,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,expected on the supposition that the energy given off was,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"proportionate to the surface of the bulb, this surface in each case","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"representing one of the coatings of a condenser. Accordingly, time","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,was less difference between the largest and the middle sized than,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,between the latter and the smallest bulb.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,An interesting observation was made in this experiment. The three,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,bulbs were suspended from a straight bare wire connected to a terminal,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of the coil, the largest bulb being placed at the end of the wire, at","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"some distance from it the smallest bulb, and an equal distance from","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the latter the middle-sized one. The carbons glowed then in both the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"larger bulbs about as expected, but the smallest did not get its share","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"by far. This observation led me to exchange the position of the bulbs,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and I then observed that whichever of the bulbs was in the middle it,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,was by far less bright than it was in any other position. This,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"mystifying result was, of course, found to be due to the electrostatic","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,action between the bulbs. When they were placed at a considerable,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"distance, or when they were attached to the corners of an equilateral","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"triangle of copper wire, they glowed about in the order determined by","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,their surfaces.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"As to the shape of the vessel, it is also of some importance,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,especially at high degrees of exhaustion. Of all the possible,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"constructions, it seems that a spherical globe with the refractory","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,body mounted in its centre is the best to employ. In experience it has,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,been demonstrated that in such a globe a refractory body of a given,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,bulk is more easily brought to incandescence than when otherwise,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,shaped bulbs are used. There is also an advantage in giving to the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"incandescent body the shape of a sphere, for self-evident reasons. In","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"any case the body should be mounted in the centre, where the atoms","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,rebounding from the glass collide. This object is best attained in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the spherical bulb; but it is also attained in a cylindrical vessel,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"with one or two straight filaments coinciding with its axis, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,possibly also in parabolical or spherical bulbs with the refractory,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,body or bodies placed in the focus or foci of the same; though the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"latter is not probable, as the electrified atoms should in all cases","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"rebound normally from the surface they strike, unless the speed were","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"excessive, in which case they _would_ probably follow the general law","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of reflection. No matter what shape the vessel may have, if the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"exhaustion be low, a filament mounted in the globe is brought to the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,same degree of incandescence in all parts; but if the exhaustion be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"high and the bulb be spherical or pear-shaped, as usual, focal points","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,form and the filament is heated to a higher degree at or near such,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,points.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"To illustrate the effect, I have here two small bulbs which are alike,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,only one is exhausted to a low and the other to a very high degree.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"When connected to the coil, the filament in the former glows uniformly","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"throughout all its length; whereas in the latter, that portion of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,filament which is in the centre of the bulb glows far more intensely,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,than the rest. A curious point is that the phenomenon occurs even if,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"two filaments are mounted in a bulb, each being connected to one","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"terminal of the coil, and, what is still more curious, if they be very","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"near together, provided the vacuum be very high. I noted in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,experiments with such bulbs that the filaments would give way usually,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"at a certain point, and in the first trials I attributed it to a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,defect in the carbon. But when the phenomenon occurred many times in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,succession I recognized its real cause.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,In order to bring a refractory body inclosed in a bulb to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"incandescence, it is desirable, on account of economy, that all the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,energy supplied to the bulb from the source should reach without loss,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the body to be heated; from there, and from nowhere else, it should be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"radiated. It is, of course, out of the question to reach this","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"theoretical result, but it is possible by a proper construction of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,illuminating device to approximate it more or less.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"For many reasons, the refractory body is placed in the centre of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"bulb, and it is usually supported on a glass stem containing the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"leading-in wire. As the potential of this wire is alternated, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"rarefied gas surrounding the stem is acted upon inductively, and the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,glass stem is violently bombarded and heated. In this manner by far,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the greater portion of the energy supplied to the bulb--especially,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,when exceedingly high frequencies are used--may be lost for the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"purpose contemplated. To obviate this loss, or at least to reduce it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to a minimum, I usually screen the rarefied gas surrounding the stem","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,from the inductive action of the leading-in wire by providing the stem,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,with a tube or coating of conducting material. It seems beyond doubt,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"that the best among metals to employ for this purpose is aluminium, on","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,account of its many remarkable properties. Its only fault is that it,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is easily fusible, and, therefore, its distance from the incandescing","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"body should be properly estimated. Usually, a thin tube, of a diameter","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"somewhat smaller than that of the glass stem, is made of the finest","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"aluminium sheet, and slipped on the stem. The tube is conveniently","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,prepared by wrapping around a rod fastened in a lathe a piece of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"aluminium sheet of the proper size, grasping the sheet firmly with","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"clean chamois leather or blotting paper, and spinning the rod very","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"fast. The sheet is wound tightly around the rod, and a highly polished","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,tube of one or three layers of the sheet is obtained. When slipped on,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the stem, the pressure is generally sufficient to prevent it from","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"slipping off, but, for safety, the lower edge of the sheet may be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"turned inside. The upper inside corner of the sheet--that is, the one","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,which is nearest to the refractory incandescent body--should be cut,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"out diagonally, as it often happens that, in consequence of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"intense heat, this corner turns toward the inside and comes very near","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to, or in contact with, the wire, or filament, supporting the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,refractory body. The greater part of the energy supplied to the bulb,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is then used up in heating the metal tube, and the bulb is rendered","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,useless for the purpose. The aluminium sheet should project above the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"glass stem more or less--one inch or so--or else, if the glass be too","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"close to the incandescing body, it may be strongly heated and become","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"more or less conducting, whereupon it may be ruptured, or may, by its","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"conductivity, establish a good electrical connection between the metal","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"tube and the leading-in wire, in which case, again, most of the energy","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,will be lost in heating the former. Perhaps the best way is to make,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the top of the glass tube, for about an inch, of a much smaller","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,diameter. To still further reduce the danger arising from the heating,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of the glass stem, and also with the view of preventing an electrical","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"connection between the metal tube and the electrode, I preferably wrap","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the stem with several layers of thin mica, which extends at least as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,far as the metal tube. In some bulbs I have also used an outside,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,insulating cover.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The preceding remarks are only made to aid the experimenter in the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"first trials, for the difficulties which he encounters he may soon","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,find means to overcome in his own way.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"To illustrate the effect of the screen, and the advantage of using it,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"I have here two bulbs of the same size, with their stems, leading-in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"wires and incandescent lamp filaments tied to the latter, as nearly","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,alike as possible. The stem of one bulb is provided with an aluminium,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"tube, the stem of the other has none. Originally the two bulbs were","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,joined by a tube which was connected to a Sprengel pump. When a high,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"vacuum had been reached, first the connecting tube, and then the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"bulbs, were sealed off; they are therefore of the same degree of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,exhaustion. When they are separately connected to the coil giving a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"certain potential, the carbon filament in the bulb provided with the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"aluminium screen is rendered highly incandescent, while the filament","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in the other bulb may, with the same potential, not even come to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"redness, although in reality the latter bulb takes generally more","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,energy than the former. When they are both connected together to the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"terminal, the difference is even more apparent, showing the importance","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of the screening. The metal tube placed on the stem containing the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,leading-in wire performs really two distinct functions: First: it acts,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"more or less as an electrostatic screen, thus economizing the energy","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"supplied to the bulb; and, second, to whatever extent it may fail to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"act electrostatically, it acts mechanically, preventing the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"bombardment, and consequently intense heating and possible","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,deterioration of the slender support of the refractory incandescent,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"body, or of the glass stem containing the leading-in wire. I say","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"_slender_ support, for it is evident that in order to confine the heat","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,more completely to the incandescing body its support should be very,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"thin, so as to carry away the smallest possible amount of heat by","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,conduction. Of all the supports used I have found an ordinary,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"incandescent lamp filament to be the best, principally because among","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,conductors it can withstand the highest degrees of heat.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The effectiveness of the metal tube as an electrostatic screen depends,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,largely on the degree of exhaustion.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,At excessively high degrees of exhaustion--which are reached by using,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,great care and special means in connection with the Sprengel,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"pump--when the matter in the globe is in the ultra-radiant state, it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,acts most perfectly. The shadow of the upper edge of the tube is then,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,sharply defined upon the bulb.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"At a somewhat lower degree of exhaustion, which is about the ordinary","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"""non-striking"" vacuum, and generally as long as the matter moves","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"predominantly in straight lines, the screen still does well. In","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,elucidation of the preceding remark it is necessary to state that what,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is a ""non-striking"" vacuum for a coil operated, as ordinarily, by","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"impulses, or currents, of low-frequency, is not, by far, so when the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,coil is operated by currents of very high frequency. In such case the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,discharge may pass with great freedom through the rarefied gas through,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"which a low-frequency discharge may not pass, even though the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,potential be much higher. At ordinary atmospheric pressures just the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"reverse rule holds good: the higher the frequency, the less the spark","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"discharge is able to jump between the terminals, especially if they","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,are knobs or spheres of some size.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Finally, at very low degrees of exhaustion, when the gas is well","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"conducting, the metal tube not only does not act as an electrostatic","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"screen, but even is a drawback, aiding to a considerable extent the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"dissipation of the energy laterally from the leading-in wire. This, of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"course, is to be expected. In this case, namely, the metal tube is in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"good electrical connection with the leading-in wire, and most of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,bombardment is directed upon the tube. As long as the electrical,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"connection is not good, the conducting tube is always of some","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"advantage, for although it may not greatly economize energy, still it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"protects the support of the refractory button, and is a means for","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,concentrating more energy upon the same.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,To whatever extent the aluminium tube performs the function of a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"screen, its usefulness is therefore limited to very high degrees of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"exhaustion when it is insulated from the electrode--that is, when the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"gas as a whole is non-conducting, and the molecules, or atoms, act as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,independent carriers of electric charges.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"In addition to acting as a more or less effective screen, in the true","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"meaning of the word, the conducting tube or coating may also act, by","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"reason of its conductivity, as a sort of equalizer or dampener of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"bombardment against the stem. To be explicit, I assume the action as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,follows: Suppose a rhythmical bombardment to occur against the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"conducting tube by reason of its imperfect action as a screen, it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"certainly must happen that some molecules, or atoms, strike the tube","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,sooner than others. Those which come first in contact with it give up,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"their superfluous charge, and the tube is electrified, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,electrification instantly spreading over its surface. But this must,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"diminish the energy lost in the bombardment for two reasons: first,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the charge given up by the atoms spreads over a great area, and hence","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the electric density at any point is small, and the atoms are repelled","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,with less energy than they would be if they would strike against a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"good insulator: secondly, as the tube is electrified by the atoms","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"which first come in contact with it, the progress of the following","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,atoms against the tube is more or less checked by the repulsion which,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the electrified tube must exert upon the similarly electrified atoms.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,This repulsion may perhaps be sufficient to prevent a large portion of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the atoms from striking the tube, but at any rate it must diminish the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,energy of their impact. It is clear that when the exhaustion is very,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"low, and the rarefied gas well conducting, neither of the above","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"effects can occur, and, on the other hand, the fewer the atoms, with","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the greater freedom they move; in other words, the higher the degree","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of exhaustion, up to a limit, the more telling will be both the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,effects.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,What I have just said may afford an explanation of the phenomenon,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"observed by Prof. Crookes, namely, that a discharge through a bulb is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,established with much greater facility when an insulator than when a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"conductor is present in the same. In my opinion, the conductor acts as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,a dampener of the motion of the atoms in the two ways pointed out;,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"hence, to cause a visible discharge to pass through the bulb, a much","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"higher potential is needed if a conductor, especially of much surface,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,be present.,"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,conducting--and most generally it is sufficiently so--the space,"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,Fig. 20 shows a bulb made for experimental purposes. In this bulb the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"aluminium tube is provided with an external connection, which serves","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to investigate the effect of the tube under various conditions. It is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,referred to chiefly to suggest a line of experiment followed.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Since the bombardment against the stem containing the leading-in wire,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is due to the inductive action of the latter upon the rarefied gas, it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,is of advantage to reduce this action as far as practicable by,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"employing a very thin wire, surrounded by a very thick insulation of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"glass or other material, and by making the wire passing through the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,rarefied gas as short as practicable. To combine these features I,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"employ a large tube T (Fig. 21), which protrudes into the bulb to some","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"distance, and carries on the top a very short glass stem s, into which","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is sealed the leading-in wire w, and I protect the top of the glass","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"stem against the heat by a small, aluminium tube a and a layer of mica","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"underneath the same, as usual. The wire w, passing through the large","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"tube to the outside of the bulb, should be well insulated--with a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"glass tube, for instance--and the space between ought to be filled out","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,with some excellent insulator. Among many insulating powders I have,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"tried, I have found that mica powder is the best to employ. If this","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"precaution is not taken, the tube T, protruding into the bulb, will","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,surely be cracked in consequence of the heating by the brushes which,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"are apt to form in the upper part of the tube, near the exhausted","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"globe, especially if the vacuum be excellent, and therefore the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,potential necessary to operate the lamp very high.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Fig. 22 illustrates a similar arrangement, with a large tube T","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,protruding in to the part of the bulb containing the refractors button,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,m. In this case the wire leading from the outside into the bulb is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"omitted, the energy required being supplied through condenser coatings","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,CC. The insulating packing P should in this construction be tightly,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"fitting to the glass, and rather wide, or otherwise the discharge","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"might avoid passing through the wire w, which connects the inside","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,condenser coating to the incandescent button m. The molecular,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,bombardment against the glass stem in the bulb is a source of great,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,trouble. As illustration I will cite a phenomenon only too frequently,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and unwillingly observed. A bulb, preferably a large one, may be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"taken, and a good conducting body, such as a piece of carbon, may be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,mounted in it upon a platinum wire sealed in the glass stem. The bulb,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"may be exhausted to a fairly high degree, nearly to the point when","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,phosphorescence begins to appear.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,[Illustration: FIG. 21.--IMPROVED BULB WITH NON-CONDUCTING BUTTON.],"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,[Illustration: FIG. 22.--TYPE OF BULB WITHOUT LEADING-IN WIRE.],"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"When the bulb is connected with the coil, the piece of carbon, if","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"small, may become highly incandescent at first, but its brightness","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"immediately diminishes, and then the discharge may break through the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"glass somewhere in the middle of the stem, in the form of bright","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"sparks, in spite of the fact that the platinum wire is in good","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,electrical connection with the rarefied gas through the piece of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"carbon or metal at the top. The first sparks are singularly bright,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"recalling those drawn from a clear surface of mercury. But, as they","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"heat the glass rapidly, they, of course, lose their brightness, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"cease when the glass at the ruptured place becomes incandescent, or","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,generally sufficiently hot to conduct. When observed for the first,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"time the phenomenon must appear very curious, and shows in a striking","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"manner how radically different alternate currents, or impulses, of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"high frequency behave, as compared with steady currents, or currents","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of low frequency. With such currents--namely, the latter--the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,phenomenon would of course not occur. When frequencies such as are,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"obtained by mechanical means are used, I think that the rupture of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"glass is more or less the consequence of the bombardment, which warms","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,it up and impairs its insulating power; but with frequencies,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,obtainable with condensers I have no doubt that the glass may give way,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,without previous heating. Although this appears most singular at,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"first, it is in reality what we might expect to occur. The energy","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,supplied to the wire leading into the bulb is given off partly by,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"direct action through the carbon button, and partly by inductive","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,action through the glass surrounding the wire. The case is thus,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,analogous to that in which a condenser shunted by a conductor of low,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,resistance is connected to a source of alternating currents. As long,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"as the frequencies are low, the conductor gets the most, and the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"condenser is perfectly safe: but when the frequency becomes excessive,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the _role_ of the conductor may become quite insignificant. In the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,latter case the difference of potential at the terminals of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"condenser may become so great as to rupture the dielectric,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,notwithstanding the fact that the terminals are joined by a conductor,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of low resistance.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,[Illustration: FIG. 23.--EFFECT PRODUCED BY A RUBY DROP.],"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"It is, of course, not necessary, when it is desired to produce the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"incandescence of a body inclosed in a bulb by means of these currents,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"that the body should be a conductor, for even a perfect non-conductor","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,may be quite as readily heated. For this purpose it is sufficient to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"surround a conducting electrode with a non-conducting material, as,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"for instance, in the bulb described before in Fig. 21, in which a thin","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"incandescent lamp filament is coated with a non-conductor, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,supports a button of the same material on the top. At the start the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"bombardment goes on by inductive action through the non-conductor,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"until the same is sufficiently heated to become conducting, when the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,bombardment continues in the ordinary way.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,A different arrangement used in some of the bulbs constructed is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,illustrated in Fig. 23. In this instance a non-conductor m is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,mounted in a piece of common arc light carbon so as to project some,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,small distance above the latter. The carbon piece is connected to the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"leading-in wire passing through a glass stem, which is wrapped with","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,several layers of mica. An aluminium tube a is employed as usual for,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,screening. It is so arranged that it reaches very nearly as high as,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the carbon and only the non-conductor m projects a little above it.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The bombardment goes at first against the upper surface of carbon, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"lower parts being protected by the aluminium tube. As soon, however,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"as the non-conductor m is heated it is rendered good conducting, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"then it becomes the centre of the bombardment, being most exposed to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the same.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,I have also constructed during these experiments many such single-wire,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"bulbs with or without internal electrode, in which the radiant matter","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"was projected against, or focused upon, the body to be rendered","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,incandescent. Fig. 24 illustrates one of the bulbs used. It consists,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of a spherical globe L, provided with a long neck n, on the top, for","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,increasing the action in some cases by the application of an external,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,conducting coating. The globe L is blown out on the bottom into a very,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"small bulb b, which serves to hold it firmly in a socket S of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"insulating material into which it is cemented. A fine lamp filament f,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"supported on a wire w, passes through the centre of the globe L. The","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"filament is rendered incandescent in the middle portion, where the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,bombardment proceeding from the lower inside surface of the globe is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"most intense. The lower portion of the globe, as far as the socket S","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"reaches, is rendered conducting, either by a tinfoil coating or","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"otherwise, and the external electrode is connected to a terminal of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the coil.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The arrangement diagrammatically indicated in Fig. 24 was found to be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,an inferior one when it was desired to render incandescent a filament,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"or button supported in the centre of the globe, but it was convenient","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,when the object was to excite phosphorescence.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,In many experiments in which bodies of a different kind were mounted,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in the bulb as, for instance, indicated in Fig. 23, some observations","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of interest were made.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"It was found, among other things, that in such cases, no matter where","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the bombardment began, just as soon as a high temperature was reached","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,there was generally one of the bodies which seemed to take most of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"bombardment upon itself, the other, or others, being thereby relieved.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"This quality appeared to depend principally on the point of fusion,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and on the facility with which the body was ""evaporated,"" or,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"generally speaking, disintegrated--meaning by the latter term not only","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the throwing off of atoms, but likewise of larger lumps. The","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,observation made was in accordance with generally accepted notions. In,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,a highly exhausted bulb electricity is carried off from the electrode,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"by independent carriers, which are partly the atoms, or molecules, of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the residual atmosphere, and partly the atoms, molecules, or lumps","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,thrown off from the electrode. If the electrode is composed of bodies,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of different character, and if one of these is more easily","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"disintegrated than the others, most of the electricity supplied is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"carried off from that body, which is then brought to a higher","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"temperature than the others, and this the more, as upon an increase of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the temperature the body is still more easily disintegrated.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,It seems to me quite probable that a similar process takes place in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the bulb even with a homogeneous electrode, and I think it to be the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,principal cause of the disintegration. There is bound to be some,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"irregularity, even if the surface is highly polished, which, of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"course, is impossible with most of the refractory bodies employed as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"electrodes. Assume that a point of the electrode gets hotter,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"instantly most of the discharge passes through that point, and a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,minute patch is probably fused and evaporated. It is now possible that,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,in consequence of the violent disintegration the spot attacked sinks,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in temperature, or that a counter force is created, as in an arc; at","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"any rate, the local tearing off meets with the limitations incident to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the experiment, whereupon the same process occurs on another place. To","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the eye the electrode appears uniformly brilliant, but there are upon","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"it points constantly shifting and wandering around, of a temperature","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"far above the mean, and this materially hastens the process of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"deterioration. That some such thing occurs, at least when the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"electrode is at a lower temperature, sufficient experimental evidence","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,can be obtained in the following manner: Exhaust a bulb to a very high,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"degree, so that with a fairly high potential the discharge cannot","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"pass--that is, not a _luminous_ one, for a weak invisible discharge","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"occurs always, in all probability. Now raise slowly and carefully the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"potential, leaving the primary current on no more than for an instant.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"At a certain point, two, three, or half a dozen phosphorescent spots","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,will appear on the globe. These places of the glass are evidently more,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"violently bombarded than others, this being due to the unevenly","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"distributed electric density, necessitated, of course, by sharp","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"projections, or, generally speaking, irregularities of the electrode.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"But the luminous patches are constantly changing in position, which is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"especially well observable if one manages to produce very few, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,this indicates that the configuration of the electrode is rapidly,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,changing.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"From experiences of this kind I am led to infer that, in order to be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"most durable, the refractory button in the bulb should be in the form","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of a sphere with a highly polished surface. Such a small sphere could,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"be manufactured from a diamond or some other crystal, but a better way","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"would be to fuse, by the employment of extreme degrees of temperature,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"some oxide--as, for instance, zirconia--into a small drop, and then","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,keep it in the bulb at a temperature somewhat below its point of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,fusion.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Interesting and useful results can no doubt be reached in the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,direction of extreme degrees of heat. How can such high temperatures,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,be arrived at? How are the highest degrees of heat reached in nature?,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"By the impact of stars, by high speeds and collisions. In a collision","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,any rate of heat generation may be attained. In a chemical process we,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"are limited. When oxygen and hydrogen combine, they fall,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"metaphorically speaking, from a definite height. We cannot go very far","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"with a blast, nor by confining heat in a furnace, but in an exhausted","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,bulb we can concentrate any amount of energy upon a minute button.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Leaving practicability out of consideration, this, then, would be the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"means which, in my opinion, would enable us to reach the highest","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,temperature. But a great difficulty when proceeding in this way is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"encountered, namely, in most cases the body is carried off before it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,can fuse and form a drop. This difficulty exists principally with an,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"oxide such as zirconia, because it cannot be compressed in so hard a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,cake that it would not be carried off quickly. I endeavored repeatedly,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to fuse zirconia, placing it in a cup or arc light carbon as indicated","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in Fig. 23. It glowed with a most intense light, and the stream of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,particles projected out of the carbon cup was of a vivid white: but,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"whether it was compressed in a cake or made into a paste with carbon,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,it was carried off before it could be fused. The carbon cup containing,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the zirconia had to be mounted very low in the neck of a large bulb,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,as the heating of the glass by the projected particles of the oxide,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,was so rapid that in the first trial the bulb was cracked almost in an,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,instant when the current was turned on. The heating of the glass by,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the projected particles was found to be always greater when the carbon,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,cup contained a body which was rapidly carried off--I presume because,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in such cases, with the same potential, higher speeds were reached,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and also because, per unit of time, more matter was projected--that","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is, more particles would strike the glass.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The before mentioned difficulty did not exist, however, when the body","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,mounted in the carbon cup offered great resistance to deterioration.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"For instance, when an oxide was first fused in an oxygen blast and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"then mounted in the bulb, it melted very readily into a drop.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Generally during the process of fusion magnificent light effects were,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"noted, of which it would be difficult to give an adequate idea. Fig.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,23 is intended to illustrate the effect observed with a ruby drop. At,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,first one may see a narrow funnel of white light projected against the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"top of the globe, where it produces an irregularly outlined","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,phosphorescent patch. When the point of the ruby fuses the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,phosphorescence becomes very powerful; but as the atoms are projected,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"with much greater speed from the surface of the drop, soon the glass","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"gets hot and ""tired,"" and now only the outer edge of the patch glows.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"In this manner an intensely phosphorescent, sharply defined line, _l_,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"corresponding to the outline of the drop, is produced, which spreads","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,slowly over the globe as the drop gets larger. When the mass begins to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"boil, small bubbles and cavities are formed, which cause dark colored","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,spots to sweep across the globe. The bulb may be turned downward,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"without fear of the drop falling off, as the mass possesses","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,considerable viscosity.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"I may mention here another feature of some interest, which I believe","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to have noted in the course of these experiments, though the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,observations do not amount to a certitude. It _appeared_ that under,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the molecular impact caused by the rapidly alternating potential the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,body was fused and maintained in that state at a lower temperature in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,a highly exhausted bulb than was the case at normal pressure and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"application of heat in the ordinary way--that is, at least, judging","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,from the quantity of the light emitted. One of the experiments,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,performed may be mentioned here by way of illustration. A small piece,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of pumice stone was stuck on a platinum wire, and first melted to it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,in a gas burner. The wire was next placed between two pieces of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"charcoal and a burner applied so as to produce an intense heat,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,sufficient to melt down the pumice stone into a small glass-like,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,button. The platinum wire had to be taken of sufficient thickness to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"prevent its melting in the fire. While in the charcoal fire, or when","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"held in a burner to get a better idea of the degree of heat, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,button glowed with great brilliancy. The wire with the button was then,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"mounted in a bulb, and upon exhausting the same to a high degree, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,current was turned on slowly so as to prevent the cracking of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"button. The button was heated to the point of fusion, and when it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"melted it did not, apparently, glow with the same brilliancy as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"before, and this would indicate a lower temperature. Leaving out of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"consideration the observer's possible, and even probable, error, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"question is, can a body under these conditions be brought from a solid","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to a liquid state with evolution of _less_ light?,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,When the potential of a body is rapidly alternated it is certain that,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the structure is jarred. When the potential is very high, although the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"vibrations may be few--say 20,000 per second--the effect upon the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"structure may be considerable. Suppose, for example, that a ruby is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,melted into a drop by a steady application of energy. When it forms a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"drop it will emit visible and invisible waves, which will be in a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"definite ratio, and to the eye the drop will appear to be of a certain","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"brilliancy. Next, suppose we diminish to any degree we choose the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"energy steadily supplied, and, instead, supply energy which rises and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"falls according to a certain law. Now, when the drop is formed, there","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,will be emitted from it three different kinds of vibrations--the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"ordinary visible, and two kinds of invisible waves: that is, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"ordinary dark waves of all lengths, and, in addition, waves of a well","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,defined character. The latter would not exist by a steady supply of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the energy; still they help to jar and loosen the structure. If this,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"really be the case, then the ruby drop will emit relatively less","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,visible and more invisible waves than before. Thus it would seem that,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"when a platinum wire, for instance, is fused by currents alternating","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"with extreme rapidity, it emits at the point of fusion less light and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"more invisible radiation than it does when melted by a steady current,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,though the total energy used up in the process of fusion is the same,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in both cases. Or, to cite another example, a lamp filament is not","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,capable of withstanding as long with currents of extreme frequency as,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"it does with steady currents, assuming that it be worked at the same","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,luminous intensity. This means that for rapidly alternating currents,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the filament should be shorter and thicker. The higher the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frequency--that is, the greater the departure from the steady","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,flow--the worse it would be for the filament. But if the truth of this,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"remark were demonstrated, it would be erroneous to conclude that such","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,a refractory button as used in these bulbs would be deteriorated,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,quicker by currents of extremely high frequency than by steady or low,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,frequency currents. From experience I may say that just the opposite,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,holds good: the button withstands the bombardment better with currents,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of very high frequency. But this is due to the fact that a high,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,frequency discharge passes through a rarefied gas with much greater,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"freedom than a steady or low frequency discharge, and this will say","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,that with the former we can work with a lower potential or with a less,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"violent impact. As long, then, as the gas is of no consequence, a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,steady or low frequency current is better; but as soon as the action,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of the gas is desired and important, high frequencies are preferable.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,In the course of these experiments a great many trials were made with,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,all kinds of carbon buttons. Electrodes made of ordinary carbon,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,buttons were decidedly more durable when the buttons were obtained by,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the application of enormous pressure. Electrodes prepared by,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,depositing carbon in well known ways did not show up well; they,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,blackened the globe very quickly. From many experiences I conclude,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,that lamp filaments obtained in this manner can be advantageously used,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,only with low potentials and low frequency currents. Some kinds of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"carbon withstand so well that, in order to bring them to the point of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"fusion, it is necessary to employ very small buttons. In this case the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,observation is rendered very difficult on account of the intense heat,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,produced. Nevertheless there can be no doubt that all kinds of carbon,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"are fused under the molecular bombardment, but the liquid state must","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,be one of great instability. Of all the bodies tried there were two,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,which withstood best--diamond and carborundum. These two showed up,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"about equally, but the latter was preferable, for many reasons. As it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is more than likely that this body is not yet generally known, I will","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,venture to call your attention to it.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"It has been recently produced by Mr. E.G. Acheson, of Monongahela","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"City, Pa., U.S.A. It is intended to replace ordinary diamond powder","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"for polishing precious stones, etc., and I have been informed that it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,accomplishes this object quite successfully. I do not know why the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"name ""carborundum"" has been given to it, unless there is something in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the process of its manufacture which justifies this selection. Through,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the kindness of the inventor, I obtained a short while ago some","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,samples which I desired to test in regard to their qualities of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,phosphorescence and capability of withstanding high degrees of heat.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Carborundum can be obtained in two forms--in the form of ""crystals""","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and of powder. The former appear to the naked eye dark colored, but","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,are very brilliant; the latter is of nearly the same color as ordinary,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"diamond powder, but very much finer. When viewed under a microscope","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the samples of crystals given to me did not appear to have any,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"definite form, but rather resembled pieces of broken up egg coal of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"fine quality. The majority were opaque, but there were some which were","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,transparent and colored. The crystals are a kind of carbon containing,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"some impurities; they are extremely hard, and withstand for a long","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,time even an oxygen blast. When the blast is directed against them,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"they at first form a cake of some compactness, probably in consequence","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of the fusion of impurities they contain. The mass withstands for a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,very long time the blast without further fusion; but a slow carrying,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"off, or burning, occurs, and, finally, a small quantity of a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"glass-like residue is left, which, I suppose, is melted alumina. When","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"compressed strongly they conduct very well, but not as well as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"ordinary carbon. The powder, which is obtained from the crystals in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"some way, is practically non-conducting. It affords a magnificent","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,polishing material for stones.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The time has been too short to make a satisfactory study of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"properties of this product, but enough experience has been gained in a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,few weeks I have experimented upon it to say that it does possess some,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,remarkable properties in many respects. It withstands excessively high,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"degrees of heat, it is little deteriorated by molecular bombardment,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and it does not blacken the globe as ordinary carbon does. The only,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,difficulty which I have found in its use in connection with these,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,experiments was to find some binding material which would resist the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,heat and the effect of the bombardment as successfully as carborundum,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,itself does.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,I have here a number of bulbs which I have provided with buttons of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,carborundum. To make such a button of carborundum crystals I proceed,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,in the following manner: I take an ordinary lamp filament and dip its,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"point in tar, or some other thick substance or paint which may be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,readily carbonized. I next pass the point of the filament through the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"crystals, and then hold it vertically over a hot plate. The tar","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"softens and forms a drop on the point of the filament, the crystals","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,adhering to the surface of the drop. By regulating the distance from,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the plate the tar is slowly dried out and the button becomes solid. I,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,then once more dip the button in tar and hold it again over a plate,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"until the tar is evaporated, leaving only a hard mass which firmly","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,binds the crystals. When a larger button is required I repeat the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"process several times, and I generally also cover the filament a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,certain distance below the button with crystals. The button being,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"mounted in a bulb, when a good vacuum has been reached, first a weak","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and then a strong discharge is passed through the bulb to carbonize,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the tar and expel all gases, and later it is brought to a very intense","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,incandescence.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,When the powder is used I have found it best to proceed as follows: I,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"make a thick paint of carborundum and tar, and pass a lamp filament","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,through the paint. Taking then most of the paint off by rubbing the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"filament against a piece of chamois leather, I hold it over a hot","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,plate until the tar evaporates and the coating becomes firm. I repeat,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,this process as many times as it is necessary to obtain a certain,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,thickness of coating. On the point of the coated filament I form a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,button in the same manner.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,There is no doubt that such a button--properly prepared under great,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"pressure--of carborundum, especially of powder of the best quality,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,will withstand the effect of the bombardment fully as well as anything,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"we know. The difficulty is that the binding material gives way, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the carborundum is slowly thrown off after some time. As it does not,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"seem to blacken the globe in the least, it might be found useful for","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"coating the filaments of ordinary incandescent lamps, and I think that","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,it is even possible to produce thin threads or sticks of carborundum,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,which will replace the ordinary filaments in an incandescent lamp. A,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"carborundum coating seems to be more durable than other coatings, not","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"only because the carborundum can withstand high degrees of heat, but","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,also because it seems to unite with the carbon better than any other,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"material I have tried. A coating of zirconia or any other oxide, for","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"instance, is far more quickly destroyed. I prepared buttons of diamond","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"dust in the same manner as of carborundum, and these came in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"durability nearest to those prepared of carborundum, but the binding","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"paste gave way much more quickly in the diamond buttons: this,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"however, I attributed to the size and irregularity of the grains of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the diamond.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,It was of interest to find whether carborundum possesses the quality,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of phosphorescence. One is, of course, prepared to encounter two","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"difficulties: first, as regards the rough product, the ""crystals,""","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"they are good conducting, and it is a fact that conductors do not","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"phosphoresce; second, the powder, being exceedingly fine, would not be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"apt to exhibit very prominently this quality, since we know that when","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"crystals, even such as diamond or ruby, are finely powdered, they lose","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the property of phosphorescence to a considerable degree.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The question presents itself here, can a conductor phosphoresce? What","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is there in such a body as a metal, for instance, that would deprive","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"it of the quality of phosphorescence, unless it is that property which","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,characterizes it as a conductor? for it is a fact that most of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,phosphorescent bodies lose that quality when they are sufficiently,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"heated to become more or less conducting. Then, if a metal be in a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"large measure, or perhaps entirely, deprived of that property, it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,should be capable of phosphorescence. Therefore it is quite possible,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"that at some extremely high frequency, when behaving practically as a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"non-conductor, a metal or any other conductor might exhibit the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"quality of phosphorescence, even though it be entirely incapable of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,phosphorescing under the impact of a low-frequency discharge. There,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is, however, another possible way how a conductor might at least","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,_appear_ to phosphoresce.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Considerable doubt still exists as to what really is phosphorescence,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and as to whether the various phenomena comprised under this head are,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"due to the same causes. Suppose that in an exhausted bulb, under the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"molecular impact, the surface of a piece of metal or other conductor","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is rendered strongly luminous, but at the same time it is found that","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"it remains comparatively cool, would not this luminosity be called","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"phosphorescence? Now such a result, theoretically at least, is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"possible, for it is a mere question of potential or speed. Assume the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"potential of the electrode, and consequently the speed of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"projected atoms, to be sufficiently high, the surface of the metal","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,piece against which the atoms are projected would be rendered highly,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"incandescent, since the process of heat generation would be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,incomparably faster than that of radiating or conducting away from the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,surface of the collision. In the eye of the observer a single impact,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of the atoms would cause an instantaneous flash, but if the impacts","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,were repeated with sufficient rapidity they would produce a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,continuous impression upon his retina. To him then the surface of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,metal would appear continuously incandescent and of constant luminous,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"intensity, while in reality the light would be either intermittent or","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,at least changing periodically in intensity. The metal piece would,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,rise in temperature until equilibrium was attained--that is until the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,energy continuously radiated would equal that intermittently supplied.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,But the supplied energy might under such conditions not be sufficient,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to bring the body to any more than a very moderate mean temperature,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,especially if the frequency of the atomic impacts be very low--just,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,enough that the fluctuation of the intensity of the light emitted,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"could not be detected by the eye. The body would now, owing to the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"manner in which the energy is supplied, emit a strong light, and yet","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,be at a comparatively very low mean temperature. How could the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,observer call the luminosity thus produced? Even if the analysis of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the light would teach him something definite, still he would probably","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,rank it under the phenomena of phosphorescence. It is conceivable that,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,in such a way both conducting and non-conducting bodies may be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"maintained at a certain luminous intensity, but the energy required","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,would very greatly vary with the nature and properties of the bodies.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,These and some foregoing remarks of a speculative nature were made,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,merely to bring out curious features of alternate currents or electric,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"impulses. By their help we may cause a body to emit _more_ light,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"while at a certain mean temperature, than it would emit if brought to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"that temperature by a steady supply; and, again, we may bring a body","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to the point of fusion, and cause it to emit _less_ light than when","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,fused by the application of energy in ordinary ways. It all depends on,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"how we supply the energy, and what kind of vibrations we set up: in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"one case the vibrations are more, in the other less, adapted to affect","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,our sense of vision.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Some effects, which I had not observed before, obtained with","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"carborundum in the first trials, I attributed to phosphorescence, but","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,in subsequent experiments it appeared that it was devoid of that,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,quality. The crystals possess a noteworthy feature. In a bulb provided,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"with a single electrode in the shape of a small circular metal disc,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"for instance, at a certain degree of exhaustion the electrode is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"covered with a milky film, which is separated by a dark space from the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,glow filling the bulb. When the metal disc is covered with carborundum,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"crystals, the film is far more intense, and snow-white. This I found","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"later to be merely an effect of the bright surface of the crystals,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,for when an aluminium electrode was highly polished it exhibited more,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,or less the same phenomenon. I made a number of experiments with the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"samples of crystals obtained, principally because it would have been","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of special interest to find that they are capable of phosphorescence,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,on account of their being conducting. I could not produce,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"phosphorescence distinctly, but I must remark that a decisive opinion","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,cannot be formed until other experimenters have gone over the same,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,ground.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The powder behaved in some experiments as though it contained alumina,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,but it did not exhibit with sufficient distinctness the red of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,latter. Its dead color brightens considerably under the molecular,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"impact, but I am now convinced it does not phosphoresce. Still, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"tests with the powder are not conclusive, because powdered carborundum","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"probably does not behave like a phosphorescent sulphide, for example,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"which could be finely powdered without impairing the phosphorescence,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"but rather like powdered ruby or diamond, and therefore it would be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"necessary, in order to make a decisive test, to obtain it in a large","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,lump and polish up the surface.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,If the carborundum proves useful in connection with these and similar,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"experiments, its chief value will be found in the production of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"coatings, thin conductors, buttons, or other electrodes capable of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,withstanding extremely high degrees of heat.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The production of a small electrode capable of withstanding enormous,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,temperatures I regard as of the greatest importance in the manufacture,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of light. It would enable us to obtain, by means of currents of very","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"high frequencies, certainly 20 times, if not more, the quantity of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,light which is obtained in the present incandescent lamp by the same,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"expenditure of energy. This estimate may appear to many exaggerated,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,but in reality I think it is far from being so. As this statement,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,might be misunderstood I think it necessary to expose clearly the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"problem with which in this line of work we are confronted, and the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"manner in which, in my opinion, a solution will be arrived at.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Any one who begins a study of the problem will be apt to think that,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,what is wanted in a lamp with an electrode is a very high degree of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,incandescence of the electrode. There he will be mistaken. The high,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"incandescence of the button is a necessary evil, but what is really","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,wanted is the high incandescence of the gas surrounding the button. In,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"other words, the problem in such a lamp is to bring a mass of gas to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the highest possible incandescence. The higher the incandescence, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"quicker the mean vibration, the greater is the economy of the light","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,production. But to maintain a mass of gas at a high degree of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"incandescence in a glass vessel, it will always be necessary to keep","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the incandescent mass away from the glass; that is, to confine it as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,much as possible to the central portion of the globe.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,In one of the experiments this evening a brush was produced at the end,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of a wire. This brush was a flame, a source of heat and light. It did","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"not emit much perceptible heat, nor did it glow with an intense light;","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,but is it the less a flame because it does not scorch my hand? Is it,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the less a flame because it does not hurt my eye by its brilliancy?,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The problem is precisely to produce in the bulb such a flame, much","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"smaller in size, but incomparably more powerful. Were there means at","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"hand for producing electric impulses of a sufficiently high frequency,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and for transmitting them, the bulb could be done away with, unless it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"were used to protect the electrode, or to economize the energy by","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"confining the heat. But as such means are not at disposal, it becomes","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,necessary to place the terminal in a bulb and rarefy the air in the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,same. This is done merely to enable the apparatus to perform the work,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,which it is not capable of performing at ordinary air pressure. In the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,bulb we are able to intensify the action to any degree--so far that,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the brush emits a powerful light.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The intensity of the light emitted depends principally on the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frequency and potential of the impulses, and on the electric density","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of the surface of the electrode. It is of the greatest importance to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"employ the smallest possible button, in order to push the density very","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,far. Under the violent impact of the molecules of the gas surrounding,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"it, the small electrode is of course brought to an extremely high","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"temperature, but around it is a mass of highly incandescent gas, a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"flame photosphere, many hundred times the volume of the electrode.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"With a diamond, carborundum or zirconia button the photosphere can be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,as much as one thousand times the volume of the button. Without much,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,reflecting one would think that in pushing so far the incandescence of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the electrode it would be instantly volatilized. But after a careful,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"consideration he would find that, theoretically, it should not occur,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and in this fact--which, however, is experimentally demonstrated--lies","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,principally the future value of such a lamp.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"At first, when the bombardment begins, most of the work is performed","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"on the surface of the button, but when a highly conducting photosphere","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,is formed the button is comparatively relieved. The higher the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,incandescence of the photosphere the more it approaches in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"conductivity to that of the electrode, and the more, therefore, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,solid and the gas form one conducting body. The consequence is that,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the further is forced the incandescence the more work, comparatively,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is performed on the gas, and the less on the electrode. The formation","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of a powerful photosphere is consequently the very means for,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"protecting the electrode. This protection, of course, is a relative","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"one, and it should not be thought that by pushing the incandescence","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"higher the electrode is actually less deteriorated. Still,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"theoretically, with extreme frequencies, this result must be reached,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,but probably at a temperature too high for most of the refractory,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"bodies known. Given, then, an electrode which can withstand to a very","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"high limit the effect of the bombardment and outward strain, it would","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,be safe no matter how much it is forced beyond that limit. In an,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,incandescent lamp quite different considerations apply. There the gas,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,is not at all concerned: the whole of the work is performed on the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,filament; and the life of the lamp diminishes so rapidly with the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,increase of the degree of incandescence that economical reasons compel,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,us to work it at a low incandescence. But if an incandescent lamp is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"operated with currents of very high frequency, the action of the gas","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"cannot be neglected, and the rules for the most economical working","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,must be considerably modified.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,In order to bring such a lamp with one or two electrodes to a great,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"perfection, it is necessary to employ impulses of very high frequency.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The high frequency secures, among others, two chief advantages, which","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,have a most important bearing upon the economy of the light,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"production. First, the deterioration of the electrode is reduced by","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"reason of the fact that we employ a great many small impacts, instead","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of a few violent ones, which shatter quickly the structure; secondly,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the formation of a large photosphere is facilitated.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"In order to reduce the deterioration of the electrode to the minimum,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"it is desirable that the vibration be harmonic, for any suddenness","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,hastens the process of destruction. An electrode lasts much longer,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"when kept at incandescence by currents, or impulses, obtained from a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"high-frequency alternator, which rise and fall more or less","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"harmonically, than by impulses obtained from a disruptive discharge","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,coil. In the latter case there is no doubt that most of the damage is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,done by the fundamental sudden discharges.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,One of the elements of loss in such a lamp is the bombardment of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"globe. As the potential is very high, the molecules are projected with","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"great speed; they strike the glass, and usually excite a strong","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"phosphorescence. The effect produced is very pretty, but for","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"economical reasons it would be perhaps preferable to prevent, or at","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"least reduce to the minimum, the bombardment against the globe, as in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"such case it is, as a rule, not the object to excite phosphorescence,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and as some loss of energy results from the bombardment. This loss in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the bulb is principally dependent on the potential of the impulses and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,on the electric density on the surface of the electrode. In employing,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,very high frequencies the loss of energy by the bombardment is greatly,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"reduced, for, first, the potential needed to perform a given amount of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"work is much smaller; and, secondly, by producing a highly conducting","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"photosphere around the electrode, the same result is obtained as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"though the electrode were much larger, which is equivalent to a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,smaller electric density. But be it by the diminution of the maximum,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"potential or of the density, the gain is effected in the same manner,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"namely, by avoiding violent shocks, which strain the glass much beyond","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,its limit of elasticity. If the frequency could be brought high,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"enough, the loss due to the imperfect elasticity of the glass would be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"entirely negligible. The loss due to bombardment of the globe may,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"however, be reduced by using two electrodes instead of one. In such","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,case each of the electrodes may be connected to one of the terminals;,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"or else, if it is preferable to use only one wire, one electrode may","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,be connected to one terminal and the other to the ground or to an,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"insulated body of some surface, as, for instance, a shade on the lamp.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"In the latter case, unless some judgment is used, one of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,electrodes might glow more intensely than the other.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,But on the whole I find it preferable when using such high frequencies,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to employ only one electrode and one connecting wire. I am convinced,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,that the illuminating device of the near future will not require for,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"its operation more than one lead, and, at any rate, it will have no","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"leading-in wire, since the energy required can be as well transmitted","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,through the glass. In experimental bulbs the leading-in wire is most,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"generally used on account of convenience, as in employing condenser","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"coatings in the manner indicated in Fig. 22, for example, there is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"some difficulty in fitting the parts, but these difficulties would not","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,exist if a great many bulbs were manufactured; otherwise the energy,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"can be conveyed through the glass as well as through a wire, and with","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,these high frequencies the losses are very small. Such illuminating,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"devices will necessarily involve the use of very high potentials, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"this, in the eyes of practical men, might be an objectionable feature.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Yet, in reality, high potentials are not objectionable--certainly not","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,in the least as far as the safety of the devices is concerned.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,There are two ways of rendering an electric appliance safe. One is to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"use low potentials, the other is to determine the dimensions of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,apparatus so that it is safe no matter how high a potential is used.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Of the two the latter seems to me the better way, for then the safety","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is absolute, unaffected by any possible combination of circumstances","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,which might render even a low-potential appliance dangerous to life,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and property. But the practical conditions require not only the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,judicious determination of the dimensions of the apparatus; they,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,likewise necessitate the employment of energy of the proper kind. It,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is easy, for instance, to construct a transformer capable of giving,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,when operated from an ordinary alternate current machine of low,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"tension, say 50,000 volts, which might be required to light a highly","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"exhausted phosphorescent tube, so that, in spite of the high","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"potential, it is perfectly safe, the shock from it producing no","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"inconvenience. Still, such a transformer would be expensive, and in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"itself inefficient; and, besides, what energy was obtained from it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,would not be economically used for the production of light. The,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,economy demands the employment of energy in the form of extremely,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,rapid vibrations. The problem of producing light has been likened to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,that of maintaining a certain high-pitch note by means of a bell. It,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,should be said a _barely audible_ note; and even these words would not,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"express it, so wonderful is the sensitiveness of the eye. We may","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"deliver powerful blows at long intervals, waste a good deal of energy,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and still not get what we want; or we may keep up the note by,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"delivering frequent gentle taps, and get nearer to the object sought","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"by the expenditure of much less energy. In the production of light, as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"far as the illuminating device is concerned, there can be only one","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"rule--that is, to use as high frequencies as can be obtained; but the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,means for the production and conveyance of impulses of such character,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"impose, at present at least, great limitations. Once it is decided to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"use very high frequencies, the return wire becomes unnecessary, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,all the appliances are simplified. By the use of obvious means the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,same result is obtained as though the return wire were used. It is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"sufficient for this purpose to bring in contact with the bulb, or","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"merely in the vicinity of the same, an insulated body of some surface.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The surface need, of course, be the smaller, the higher the frequency","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and potential used, and necessarily, also, the higher the economy of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the lamp or other device.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,This plan of working has been resorted to on several occasions this,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"evening. So, for instance, when the incandescence of a button was","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"produced by grasping the bulb with the hand, the body of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,experimenter merely served to intensify the action. The bulb used was,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"similar to that illustrated in Fig. 19, and the coil was excited to a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"small potential, not sufficient to bring the button to incandescence","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"when the bulb was hanging from the wire; and incidentally, in order to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"perform the experiment in a more suitable manner, the button was taken","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"so large that a perceptible time had to elapse before, upon grasping","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the bulb, it could be rendered incandescent. The contact with the bulb","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"was, of course, quite unnecessary. It is easy, by using a rather large","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"bulb with an exceedingly small electrode, to adjust the conditions so","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,that the latter is brought to bright incandescence by the mere,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"approach of the experimenter within a few feet of the bulb, and that","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the incandescence subsides upon his receding.,"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,"In another experiment, when phosphorescence was excited, a similar","Tesla, Nikola"

13476,"intensified--in this case, however, to present a different feature, by","Tesla, Nikola"

13476,"one or two fingers, one or two shadows of the stem inside were","Tesla, Nikola"

13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,In all these experiments the action was intensified by augmenting the,"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,"it is not necessary to resort to such means, and would be quite","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"unnecessary with still higher frequencies; but when it _is_ desired,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the bulb, or tube, can be easily adapted to the purpose.","Tesla, Nikola"

13476,A similar disposition with a phosphorescent tube is illustrated in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Fig. 27. The tube T is prepared from two short tubes of a different,"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,end of wire w.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The economical use of such a reflector or intensifier would require,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"that all energy supplied to an air condenser should be recoverable,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"or, in other words, that there should not be any losses, neither in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the gaseous medium nor through its action elsewhere. This is far from,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"being so, but, fortunately, the losses may be reduced to anything","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"desired. A few remarks are necessary on this subject, in order to make","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the experiences gathered in the course of these investigations,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,perfectly clear.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Suppose a small helix with many well insulated turns, as in experiment","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Fig. 17, has one of its ends connected to one of the terminals of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"induction coil, and the other to a metal plate, or, for the sake of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"simplicity, a sphere, insulated in space. When the coil is set to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"work, the potential of the sphere is alternated, and the small helix","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,now behaves as though its free end were connected to the other,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,terminal of the induction coil. If an iron rod be held within the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"small helix it is quickly brought to a high temperature, indicating","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the passage of a strong current through the helix. How does the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"insulated sphere act in this case? It can be a condenser, storing and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"returning the energy supplied to it, or it can be a mere sink of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"energy, and the conditions of the experiment determine whether it is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"more one or the other. The sphere being charged to a high potential,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"it acts inductively upon the surrounding air, or whatever gaseous","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"medium there might be. The molecules, or atoms, which are near the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"sphere are of course more attracted, and move through a greater","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,distance than the farther ones. When the nearest molecules strike the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"sphere they are repelled, and collisions occur at all distances within","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the inductive action of the sphere. It is now clear that, if the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"potential be steady, but little loss of energy can be caused in this","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"way, for the molecules which are nearest to the sphere, having had an","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"additional charge imparted to them by contact, are not attracted until","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"they have parted, if not with all, at least with most of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"additional charge, which can be accomplished only after a great many","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,collisions. From the fact that with a steady potential there is but,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"little loss in dry air, one must come to such a conclusion. When the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"potential of the sphere, instead of being steady, is alternating, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,conditions are entirely different. In this case a rhythmical,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"bombardment occurs, no matter whether the molecules after coming in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"contact with the sphere lose the imparted charge or not; what is more,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"if the charge is not lost, the impacts are only the more violent.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Still if the frequency of the impulses be very small, the loss caused","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,by the impacts and collisions would not be serious unless the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,potential were excessive. But when extremely high frequencies and more,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"or less high potentials are used, the loss may be very great. The","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,total energy lost per unit of time is proportionate to the product of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the number of impacts per second, or the frequency and the energy lost","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,in each impact. But the energy of an impact must be proportionate to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the square of the electric density of the sphere, since the charge","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,imparted to the molecule is proportionate to that density. I conclude,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,from this that the total energy lost must be proportionate to the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,product of the frequency and the square of the electric density; but,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,this law needs experimental confirmation. Assuming the preceding,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"considerations to be true, then, by rapidly alternating the potential","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of a body immersed in an insulating gaseous medium, any amount of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"energy may be dissipated into space. Most of that energy then, I","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"believe, is not dissipated in the form of long ether waves, propagated","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to considerable distance, as is thought most generally, but is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"consumed--in the case of an insulated sphere, for example--in impact","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and collisional losses--that is, heat vibrations--on the surface and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,in the vicinity of the sphere. To reduce the dissipation it is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,necessary to work with a small electric density--the smaller the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,higher the frequency.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"But since, on the assumption before made, the loss is diminished with","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the square of the density, and since currents of very high frequencies","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"involve considerable waste when transmitted through conductors, it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"follows that, on the whole, it is better to employ one wire than two.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Therefore, if motors, lamps, or devices of any kind are perfected,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,capable of being advantageously operated by currents of extremely high,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frequency, economical reasons will make it advisable to use only one","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"wire, especially if the distances are great.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,When energy is absorbed in a condenser the same behaves as though its,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"capacity were increased. Absorption always exists more or less, but","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,generally it is small and of no consequence as long as the frequencies,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"are not very great. In using extremely high frequencies, and,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"necessarily in such case, also high potentials, the absorption--or,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"what is here meant more particularly by this term, the loss of energy","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,due to the presence of a gaseous medium--is an important factor to be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"considered, as the energy absorbed in the air condenser may be any","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,fraction of the supplied energy. This would seem to make it very,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,difficult to tell from the measured or computed capacity of an air,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"condenser its actual capacity or vibration period, especially if the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,condenser is of very small surface and is charged to a very high,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,potential. As many important results are dependent upon the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"correctness of the estimation of the vibration period, this subject","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,demands the most careful scrutiny of other investigators. To reduce,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the probable error as much as possible in experiments of the kind,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"alluded to, it is advisable to use spheres or plates of large surface,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"so as to make the density exceedingly small. Otherwise, when it is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"practicable, an oil condenser should be used in preference. In oil or","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,other liquid dielectrics there are seemingly no such losses as in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,gaseous media. It being impossible to exclude entirely the gas in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"condensers with solid dielectrics, such condensers should be immersed","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in oil, for economical reasons if nothing else; they can then be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,strained to the utmost and will remain cool. In Leyden jars the loss,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"due to air is comparatively small, as the tinfoil coatings are large,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"close together, and the charged surfaces not directly exposed; but","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"when the potentials are very high, the loss may be more or less","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"considerable at, or near, the upper edge of the foil, where the air is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"principally acted upon. If the jar be immersed in boiled-out oil, it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,will be capable of performing four times the amount of work which it,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"can for any length of time when used in the ordinary way, and the loss","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,will be inappreciable.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,It should not be thought that the loss in heat in an air condenser is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,necessarily associated with the formation of _visible_ streams or,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"brushes. If a small electrode, inclosed in an unexhausted bulb, is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"connected to one of the terminals of the coil, streams can be seen to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"issue from the electrode and the air in the bulb is heated; if,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"instead of a small electrode, a large sphere is inclosed in the bulb,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"no streams are observed, still the air is heated.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Nor should it be thought that the temperature of an air condenser,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"would give even an approximate idea of the loss in heat incurred, as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in such case heat must be given off much more quickly, since there is,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in addition to the ordinary radiation, a very active carrying away of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"heat by independent carriers going on, and since not only the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"apparatus, but the air at some distance from it is heated in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,consequence of the collisions which must occur.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Owing to this, in experiments with such a coil, a rise of temperature","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,can be distinctly observed only when the body connected to the coil is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"very small. But with apparatus on a larger scale, even a body of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"considerable bulk would be heated, as, for instance, the body of a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,person; and I think that skilled physicians might make observations of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"utility in such experiments, which, if the apparatus were judiciously","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"designed, would not present the slightest danger.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"A question of some interest, principally to meteorologists, presents","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"itself here. How does the earth behave? The earth is an air condenser,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,but is it a perfect or a very imperfect one--a mere sink of energy?,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,There can be little doubt that to such small disturbance as might be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,caused in an experiment the earth behaves as an almost perfect,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,condenser. But it might be different when its charge is set in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,vibration by some sudden disturbance occurring in the heavens. In such,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"case, as before stated, probably only little of the energy of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,vibrations set up would be lost into space in the form of long ether,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"radiations, but most of the energy, I think, would spend itself in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"molecular impacts and collisions, and pass off into space in the form","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of short heat, and possibly light, waves. As both the frequency of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,vibrations of the charge and the potential are in all probability,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"excessive, the energy converted into heat may be considerable. Since","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the density must be unevenly distributed, either in consequence of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"irregularity of the earth's surface, or on account of the condition of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the atmosphere in various places, the effect produced would","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,accordingly vary from place to place. Considerable variations in the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,temperature and pressure of the atmosphere may in this manner be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,caused at any point of the surface of the earth. The variations may be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"gradual or very sudden, according to the nature of the general","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"disturbance, and may produce rain and storms, or locally modify the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,weather in any way.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,From the remarks before made one may see what an important factor of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,loss the air in the neighborhood of a charged surface becomes when the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,electric density is great and the frequency of the impulses excessive.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,But the action as explained implies that the air is insulating--that,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is, that it is composed of independent carriers immersed in an","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,insulating medium. This is the case only when the air is at something,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"like ordinary or greater, or at extremely small, pressure. When the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"air is slightly rarefied and conducting, then true conduction losses","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"occur also. In such case, of course, considerable energy may be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"dissipated into space even with a steady potential, or with impulses","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of low frequency, if the density is very great.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"When the gas is at very low pressure, an electrode is heated more","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,because higher speeds can be reached. If the gas around the electrode,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is strongly compressed, the displacements, and consequently the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"speeds, are very small, and the heating is insignificant. But if in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"such case the frequency could be sufficiently increased, the electrode","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,would be brought to a high temperature as well as if the gas were at,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"very low pressure; in fact, exhausting the bulb is only necessary","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,because we cannot produce (and possibly not convey) currents of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,required frequency.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Returning to the subject of electrode lamps, it is obviously of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,advantage in such a lamp to confine as much as possible the heat to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the electrode by preventing the circulation of the gas in the bulb. If,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"a very small bulb be taken, it would confine the heat better than a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"large one, but it might not be of sufficient capacity to be operated","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"from the coil, or, if so, the glass might get too hot. A simple way to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"improve in this direction is to employ a globe of the required size,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"but to place a small bulb, the diameter of which is properly","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"estimated, over the refractory button contained in the globe. This","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,arrangement is illustrated in Fig. 28.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,[Illustration: FIG. 28.--LAMP WITH AUXILIARY BULB FOR CONFINING THE,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,ACTION TO THE CENTRE.],"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The globe L has in this case a large neck n, allowing the small bulb b","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to slip through. Otherwise the construction is the same as shown in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Fig. 18, for example. The small bulb is conveniently supported upon","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the stem s, carrying the refractory button m. It is separated from the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"aluminium tube a by several layers of mica M, in order to prevent the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,cracking of the neck by the rapid heating of the aluminium tube upon a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,sudden turning on of the current. The inside bulb should be as small,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,as possible when it is desired to obtain light only by incandescence,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of the electrode. If it is desired to produce phosphorescence, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"bulb should be larger, else it would be apt to get too hot, and the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,phosphorescence would cease. In this arrangement usually only the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"small bulb shows phosphorescence, as there is practically no","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,bombardment against the outer globe. In some of these bulbs,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,constructed as illustrated in Fig. 28 the small tube was coated with,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"phosphorescent paint, and beautiful effects were obtained. Instead of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"making the inside bulb large, in order to avoid undue heating, it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,answers the purpose to make the electrode m larger. In this case the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,bombardment is weakened by reason of the smaller electric density.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Many bulbs were constructed on the plan illustrated in Fig. 29. Here a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"small bulb b, containing the refractory button m, upon being exhausted","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to a very high degree was sealed in a large globe L, which was then","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,moderately exhausted and sealed off. The principal advantage of this,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"construction was that it allowed of reaching extremely high vacua,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and, at the same time use a large bulb. It was found, in the course of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"experiences with bulbs such as illustrated in Fig. 29, that it was","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"well to make the stem s near the seal at e very thick, and the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"leading-in wire w thin, as it occurred sometimes that the stem at e","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,was heated and the bulb was cracked. Often the outer globe L was,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"exhausted only just enough to allow the discharge to pass through, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the space between the bulbs appeared crimson, producing a curious","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"effect. In some cases, when the exhaustion in globe L was very low,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and the air good conducting, it was found necessary, in order to bring","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the button m to high incandescence, to place, preferably on the upper","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"part of the neck of the globe, a tinfoil coating which was connected","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to an insulated body, to the ground, or to the other terminal of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"coil, as the highly conducting air weakened the effect somewhat,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"probably by being acted upon inductively from the wire w, where it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"entered the bulb at e. Another difficulty--which, however, is always","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,present when the refractory button is mounted in a very small,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"bulb--existed in the construction illustrated in Fig. 29, namely, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,vacuum in the bulb b would be impaired in a comparatively short time.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,[Illustration: FIG. 29.--LAMP WITH INDEPENDENT AUXILIARY BULB.],"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The chief idea in the two last described constructions was to confine,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the heat to the central portion of the globe by preventing the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"exchange of air. An advantage is secured, but owing to the heating of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the inside bulb and slow evaporation of the glass the vacuum is hard,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to maintain, even if the construction illustrated in Fig. 28 be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"chosen, in which both bulbs communicate.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,But by far the better way--the ideal way--would be to reach,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,sufficiently high frequencies. The higher the frequency the slower,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"would be the exchange of the air, and I think that a frequency may be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,reached at which there would be no exchange whatever of the air,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,molecules around the terminal. We would then produce a flame in which,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"there would be no carrying away of material, and a queer flame it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"would be, for it would be rigid! With such high frequencies the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"inertia of the particles would come into play. As the brush, or flame,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"would gain rigidity in virtue of the inertia of the particles, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,exchange of the latter would be prevented. This would necessarily,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"occur, for, the number of the impulses being augmented, the potential","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"energy of each would diminish, so that finally only atomic vibrations","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"could be set up, and the motion of translation through measurable","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,space would cease. Thus an ordinary gas burner connected to a source,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of rapidly alternating potential might have its efficiency augmented,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to a certain limit, and this for two reasons--because of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"additional vibration imparted, and because of a slowing down of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"process of carrying off. But the renewal being rendered difficult, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"renewal being necessary to maintain the _burner_, a continued increase","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of the frequency of the impulses, assuming they could be transmitted","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to and impressed upon the flame, would result in the ""extinction"" of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the latter, meaning by this term only the cessation of the chemical","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,process.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"I think, however, that in the case of an electrode immersed in a fluid","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"insulating medium, and surrounded by independent carriers of electric","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"charges, which can be acted upon inductively, a sufficiently high","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,frequency of the impulses would probably result in a gravitation of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the gas all around toward the electrode. For this it would be only,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,necessary to assume that the independent bodies are irregularly,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,shaped; they would then turn toward the electrode their side of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"greatest electric density, and this would be a position in which the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,fluid resistance to approach would be smaller than that offered to the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,receding.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The general opinion, I do not doubt, is that it is out of the question","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to reach any such frequencies as might--assuming some of the views,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,before expressed to be true--produce any of the results which I have,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"pointed out as mere possibilities. This may be so, but in the course","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of these investigations, from the observation of many phenomena I have","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,gained the conviction that these frequencies would be much lower than,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,one is apt to estimate at first. In a flame we set up light vibrations,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"by causing molecules, or atoms, to collide. But what is the ratio of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the frequency of the collisions and that of the vibrations set up?,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Certainly it must be incomparably smaller than that of the knocks of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the bell and the sound vibrations, or that of the discharges and the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,oscillations of the condenser. We may cause the molecules of the gas,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to collide by the use of alternate electric impulses of high,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frequency, and so we may imitate the process in a flame; and from","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"experiments with frequencies which we are now able to obtain, I think","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,that the result is producible with impulses which are transmissible,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,through a conductor.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"In connection with thoughts of a similar nature, it appeared to me of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,great interest to demonstrate the rigidity of a vibrating gaseous,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"column. Although with such low frequencies as, say 10,000 per second,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,which I was able to obtain without difficulty from a specially,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"constructed alternator, the task looked discouraging at first, I made","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,a series of experiments. The trials with air at ordinary pressure led,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to no result, but with air moderately rarefied I obtain what I think","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to be an unmistakable experimental evidence of the property sought,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,for. As a result of this kind might lead able investigators to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,conclusions of importance I will describe one of the experiments,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,performed.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,It is well known that when a tube is slightly exhausted the discharge,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,may be passed through it in the form of a thin luminous thread. When,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"produced with currents of low frequency, obtained from a coil operated","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"as usual, this thread is inert. If a magnet be approached to it, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"part near the same is attracted or repelled, according to the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,direction of the lines of force of the magnet. It occurred to me that,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,if such a thread would be produced with currents of very high,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frequency, it should be more or less rigid, and as it was visible it","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,could be easily studied. Accordingly I prepared a tube about 1 inch in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"diameter and 1 metre long, with outside coating at each end. The tube","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,was exhausted to a point at which by a little working the thread,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,discharge could be obtained. It must be remarked here that the general,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"aspect of the tube, and the degree of exhaustion, are quite different","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,than when ordinary low frequency currents are used. As it was found,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"preferable to work with one terminal, the tube prepared was suspended","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"from the end of a wire connected to the terminal, the tinfoil coating","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"being connected to the wire, and to the lower coating sometimes a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,small insulated plate was attached. When the thread was formed it,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,extended through the upper part of the tube and lost itself in the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"lower end. If it possessed rigidity it resembled, not exactly an","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"elastic cord stretched tight between two supports, but a cord","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,suspended from a height with a small weight attached at the end. When,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the finger or a magnet was approached to the upper end of the luminous,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"thread, it could be brought locally out of position by electrostatic","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,or magnetic action; and when the disturbing object was very quickly,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"removed, an analogous result was produced, as though a suspended cord","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,would be displaced and quickly released near the point of suspension.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"In doing this the luminous thread was set in vibration, and two very","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"sharply marked nodes, and a third indistinct one, were formed. The","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"vibration, once set up, continued for fully eight minutes, dying","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"gradually out. The speed of the vibration often varied perceptibly,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and it could be observed that the electrostatic attraction of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,glass affected the vibrating thread; but it was clear that the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"electrostatic action was not the cause of the vibration, for the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"thread was most generally stationary, and could always be set in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,vibration by passing the finger quickly near the upper part of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,tube. With a magnet the thread could be split in two and both parts,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"vibrated. By approaching the hand to the lower coating of the tube, or","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"insulated plate if attached, the vibration was quickened; also, as far","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"as I could see, by raising the potential or frequency. Thus, either","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,increasing the frequency or passing a stronger discharge of the same,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,frequency corresponded to a tightening of the cord. I did not obtain,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,any experimental evidence with condenser discharges. A luminous band,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,excited in a bulb by repeated discharges of a Leyden jar must possess,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"rigidity, and if deformed and suddenly released should vibrate. But","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,probably the amount of vibrating matter is so small that in spite of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the extreme speed the inertia cannot prominently assert itself.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Besides, the observation in such a case is rendered extremely","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,difficult on account of the fundamental vibration.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The demonstration of the fact--which still needs better experimental,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"confirmation--that a vibrating gaseous column possesses rigidity,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,might greatly modify the views of thinkers. When with low frequencies,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and insignificant potentials indications of that property may be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"noted, how must a gaseous medium behave under the influence of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,enormous electrostatic stresses which may be active in the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"interstellar space, and which may alternate with inconceivable","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"rapidity? The existence of such an electrostatic, rhythmically","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,throbbing force--of a vibrating electrostatic field--would show a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,possible way how solids might have formed from the ultra-gaseous,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"uterus, and how transverse and all kinds of vibrations may be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"transmitted through a gaseous medium filling all space. Then, ether","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"might be a true fluid, devoid of rigidity, and at rest, it being","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,merely necessary as a connecting link to enable interaction. What,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,determines the rigidity of a body? It must be the speed and the amount,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of moving matter. In a gas the speed may be considerable, but the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,density is exceedingly small; in a liquid the speed would be likely to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"be small, though the density may be considerable; and in both cases","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the inertia resistance offered to displacement is practically _nil_.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"But place a gaseous (or liquid) column in an intense, rapidly","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"alternating electrostatic field, set the particles vibrating with","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"enormous speeds, then the inertia resistance asserts itself. A body","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"might move with more or less freedom through the vibrating mass, but","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,as a whole it would be rigid.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,There is a subject which I must mention in connection with these,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,experiments: it is that of high vacua. This is a subject the study of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"which is not only interesting, but useful, for it may lead to results","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of great practical importance. In commercial apparatus, such as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"incandescent lamps, operated from ordinary systems of distribution, a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,much higher vacuum than obtained at present would not secure a very,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,great advantage. In such a case the work is performed on the filament,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and the gas is little concerned; the improvement, therefore, would be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,but trifling. But when we begin to use very high frequencies and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"potentials, the action of the gas becomes all important, and the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,degree of exhaustion materially modifies the results. As long as,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"ordinary coils, even very large ones, were used, the study of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"subject was limited, because just at a point when it became most","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"interesting it had to be interrupted on account of the ""non-striking""","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,vacuum being reached. But presently we are able to obtain from a small,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,disruptive discharge coil potentials much higher than even the largest,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"coil was capable of giving, and, what is more, we can make the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,potential alternate with great rapidity. Both of these results enable,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,us now to pass a luminous discharge through almost any vacua,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"obtainable, and the field of our investigations is greatly extended.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Think we as we may, of all the possible directions to develop a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"practical illuminant, the line of high vacua seems to be the most","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,promising at present. But to reach extreme vacua the appliances must,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"be much more improved, and ultimate perfection will not be attained","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,until we shall have discarded the mechanical and perfected an,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,_electrical_ vacuum pump. Molecules and atoms can be thrown out of a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,bulb under the action of an enormous potential: _this_ will be the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"principle of the vacuum pump of the future. For the present, we must","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,secure the best results we can with mechanical appliances. In this,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"respect, it might not be out of the way to say a few words about the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"method of, and apparatus for, producing excessively high degrees of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,exhaustion of which I have availed myself in the course of these,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,investigations. It is very probable that other experimenters have used,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,similar arrangements; but as it is possible that there may be an item,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of interest in their description, a few remarks, which will render","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"this investigation more complete, might be permitted.","Tesla, Nikola"

13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The apparatus is illustrated in a drawing shown in Fig. 30. S,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"represents a Sprengel pump, which has been specially constructed to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,better suit the work required. The stop-cock which is usually employed,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"has been omitted, and instead of it a hollow stopper s has been fitted","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in the neck of the reservoir R. This stopper has a small hole h,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,through which the mercury descends; the size of the outlet o being,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"properly determined with respect to the section of the fall tube t,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,which is sealed to the reservoir instead of being connected to it in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the usual manner. This arrangement overcomes the imperfections and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,troubles which often arise from the use of the stopcock on the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,reservoir and the connection of the latter with the fall tube.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The pump is connected through a U-shaped tube t to a very large,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,reservoir R_1. Especial care was taken in fitting the grinding,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"surfaces of the stoppers p and p_1, and both of these and the mercury","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,caps above them were made exceptionally long. After the U-shaped tube,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"was fitted and put in place, it was heated, so as to soften and take","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,off the strain resulting from imperfect fitting. The U-shaped tube was,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"provided with a stopcock C, and two ground connections g and g_1--one","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"for a small bulb b, usually containing caustic potash, and the other","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"for the receiver r, to be exhausted.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The reservoir R_1 was connected by means of a rubber tube to a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"slightly larger reservoir R_2, each of the two reservoirs being","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"provided with a stopcock C_1 and C_2, respectively. The reservoir R_2","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"could be raised and lowered by a wheel and rack, and the range of its","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,motion was so determined that when it was filled with mercury and the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"stopcock C_2 closed, so as to form a Torricellian vacuum in it when","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"raised, it could be lifted so high that the mercury in reservoir R_1","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,would stand a little above stopcock C_1; and when this stopcock was,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"closed and the reservoir R_2 descended, so as to form a Torricellian","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"vacuum in reservoir R_1, it could be lowered so far as to completely","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"empty the latter, the mercury filling the reservoir R_2 up to a little","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,above stopcock C_2.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The capacity of the pump and of the connections was taken as small as,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"possible relatively to the volume of reservoir R_1, since, of course,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the degree of exhaustion depended upon the ratio of these quantities.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,With this apparatus I combined the usual means indicated by former,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,experiments for the production of very high vacua. In most of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,experiments it was convenient to use caustic potash. I may venture to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"say, in regard to its use, that much time is saved and a more perfect","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,action of the pump insured by fusing and boiling the potash as soon,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"as, or even before, the pump settles down. If this course is not","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"followed the sticks, as ordinarily employed, may give moisture off at","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"a certain very slow rate, and the pump may work for many hours without","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,reaching a very high vacuum. The potash was heated either by a spirit,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"lamp or by passing a discharge through it, or by passing a current","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,through a wire contained in it. The advantage in the latter case was,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,that the heating could be more rapidly repeated.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Generally the process of exhaustion was the following:--At the start,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the stop-cocks C and C_1 being open, and all other connections closed,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the reservoir R_2 was raised so far that the mercury filled the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,reservoir R_1 and a part of the narrow connecting U-shaped tube. When,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the pump was set to work, the mercury would, of course, quickly rise","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in the tube, and reservoir R_2 was lowered, the experimenter keeping","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the mercury at about the same level. The reservoir R_2 was balanced,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"by a long spring which facilitated the operation, and the friction of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the parts was generally sufficient to keep it almost in any position.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"When the Sprengel pump had done its work, the reservoir R_2 was","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"further lowered and the mercury descended in R_1 and filled R_2,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,whereupon stopcock C_2 was closed. The air adhering to the walls of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"R_1 and that absorbed by the mercury was carried off, and to free the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,mercury of all air the reservoir R_2 was for a long time worked up and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"down. During this process some air, which would gather below stopcock","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"C_2, was expelled from R_2 by lowering it far enough and opening the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"stopcock, closing the latter again before raising the reservoir. When","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"all the air had been expelled from the mercury, and no air would","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"gather in R_2 when it was lowered, the caustic potash was resorted to.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,The reservoir R_2 was now again raised until the mercury in R_1 stood,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"above stopcock C_1. The caustic potash was fused and boiled, and the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,moisture partly carried off by the pump and partly re-absorbed; and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"this process of heating and cooling was repeated many times, and each","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"time, upon the moisture being absorbed or carried off, the reservoir","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,R_2 was for a long time raised and lowered. In this manner all the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"moisture was carried off from the mercury, and both the reservoirs","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,were in proper condition to be used. The reservoir R_2 was then again,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"raised to the top, and the pump was kept working for a long time. When","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the highest vacuum obtainable with the pump had been reached the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,potash bulb was usually wrapped with cotton which was sprinkled with,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"ether so as to keep the potash at a very low temperature, then the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"reservoir R_2 was lowered, and upon reservoir R_1 being emptied the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,receiver r was quickly sealed up.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"When a new bulb was put on, the mercury was always raised above","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"stopcock C_1 which was closed, so as to always keep the mercury and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"both the reservoirs in fine condition, and the mercury was never","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,withdrawn from R_1 except when the pump had reached the highest degree,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of exhaustion. It is necessary to observe this rule if it is desired,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to use the apparatus to advantage.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"By means of this arrangement I was able to proceed very quickly, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,when the apparatus was in perfect order it was possible to reach the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"phosphorescent stage in a small bulb in less than 15 minutes, which is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,certainly very quick work for a small laboratory arrangement requiring,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,all in all about 100 pounds of mercury. With ordinary small bulbs the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"ratio of the capacity of the pump, receiver, and connections, and that","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of reservoir R was about 1-20, and the degrees of exhaustion reached","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"were necessarily very high, though I am unable to make a precise and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,reliable statement how far the exhaustion was carried.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,What impresses the investigator most in the course of these,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,experiences is the behavior of gases when subjected to great rapidly,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,alternating electrostatic stresses. But he must remain in doubt as to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"whether the effects observed are due wholly to the molecules, or","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"atoms, of the gas which chemical analysis discloses to us, or whether","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"there enters into play another medium of a gaseous nature, comprising","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"atoms, or molecules, immersed in a fluid pervading the space. Such a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"medium surely must exist, and I am convinced that, for instance, even","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"if air were absent, the surface and neighborhood of a body in space","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,would be heated by rapidly alternating the potential of the body; but,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,no such heating of the surface or neighborhood could occur if all free,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"atoms were removed and only a homogeneous, incompressible, and elastic","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"fluid--such as ether is supposed to be--would remain, for then there","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"would be no impacts, no collisions. In such a case, as far as the body","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"itself is concerned, only frictional losses in the inside could occur.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,It is a striking fact that the discharge through a gas is established,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,with ever increasing freedom as the frequency of the impulses is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,augmented. It behaves in this respect quite contrarily to a metallic,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,conductor. In the latter the impedance enters prominently into play as,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the frequency is increased, but the gas acts much as a series of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,condensers would: the facility with which the discharge passes through,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"seems to depend on the rate of change of potential. If it act so, then","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in a vacuum tube even of great length, and no matter how strong the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"current, self-induction could not assert itself to any appreciable","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"degree. We have, then, as far as we can now see, in the gas a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,conductor which is capable of transmitting electric impulses of any,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,frequency which we may be able to produce. Could the frequency be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"brought high enough, then a queer system of electric distribution,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"which would be likely to interest gas companies, might be realized:","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"metal pipes filled with gas--the metal being the insulator, the gas","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the conductor--supplying phosphorescent bulbs, or perhaps devices as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,yet uninvented. It is certainly possible to take a hollow core of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"copper, rarefy the gas in the same, and by passing impulses of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"sufficiently high frequency through a circuit around it, bring the gas","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,inside to a high degree of incandescence; but as to the nature of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"forces there would be considerable uncertainty, for it would be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,doubtful whether with such impulses the copper core would act as a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,static screen. Such paradoxes and apparent impossibilities we,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"encounter at every step in this line of work, and therein lies, to a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"great extent, the claim of the study.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,I have here a short and wide tube which is exhausted to a high degree,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"and covered with a substantial coating of bronze, the coating allowing","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"barely the light to shine through. A metallic clasp, with a hook for","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"suspending the tube, is fastened around the middle portion of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"latter, the clasp being in contact with the bronze coating. I now want","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to light the gas inside by suspending the tube on a wire connected to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the coil. Any one who would try the experiment for the first time, not","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"having any previous experience, would probably take care to be quite","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"alone when making the trial, for fear that he might become the joke of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"his assistants. Still, the bulb lights in spite of the metal coating,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and the light can be distinctly perceived through the latter. A long,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,tube covered with aluminium bronze lights when held in one hand--the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,other touching the terminal of the coil--quite powerfully. It might be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"objected that the coatings are not sufficiently conducting; still,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"even if they were highly resistant, they ought to screen the gas. They","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"certainly screen it perfectly in a condition of rest, but not by far","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,perfectly when the charge is surging in the coating. But the loss of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"energy which occurs within the tube, notwithstanding the screen, is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,occasioned principally by the presence of the gas. Were we to take a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,large hollow metallic sphere and fill it with a perfect incompressible,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"fluid dielectric, there would be no loss inside of the sphere, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"consequently the inside might be considered as perfectly screened,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,though the potential be very rapidly alternating. Even were the sphere,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"filled with oil, the loss would be incomparably smaller than when the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"fluid is replaced by a gas, for in the latter case the force produces","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,displacements; that means impact and collisions in the inside.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"No matter what the pressure of the gas may be, it becomes an important","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,factor in the heating of a conductor when the electric density is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,great and the frequency very high. That in the heating of conductors,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"by lightning discharges air is an element of great importance, is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,almost as certain as an experimental fact. I may illustrate the action,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of the air by the following experiment: I take a short tube which is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,exhausted to a moderate degree and has a platinum wire running through,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the middle from one end to the other. I pass a steady or low frequency,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"current through the wire, and it is heated uniformly in all parts. The","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"heating here is due to conduction, or frictional losses, and the gas","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,around the wire has--as far as we can see--no function to perform. But,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"now let me pass sudden discharges, or a high frequency current,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"through the wire. Again the wire is heated, this time principally on","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the ends and least in the middle portion; and if the frequency of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"impulses, or the rate of change, is high enough, the wire might as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"well be cut in the middle as not, for practically all the heating is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,due to the rarefied gas. Here the gas might only act as a conductor of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,no impedance diverting the current from the wire as the impedance of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the latter is enormously increased, and merely heating the ends of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,wire by reason of their resistance to the passage of the discharge.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,But it is not at all necessary that the gas in the tube should he,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"conducting; it might be at an extremely low pressure, still the ends","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of the wire would be heated--as, however, is ascertained by","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"experience--only the two ends would in such, case not be electrically","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,connected through the gaseous medium. Now what with these frequencies,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and potentials occurs in an exhausted tube occurs in the lightning,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,discharges at ordinary pressure. We only need remember one of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"facts arrived at in the course of these investigations, namely, that","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to impulses of very high frequency the gas at ordinary pressure,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,behaves much in the same manner as though it were at moderately low,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,pressure. I think that in lightning discharges frequently wires or,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,conducting objects are volatilized merely because air is present and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"that, were the conductor immersed in an insulating liquid, it would be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"safe, for then the energy would have to spend itself somewhere else.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,From the behavior of gases to sudden impulses of high potential I am,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,led to conclude that there can be no surer way of diverting a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,lightning discharge than by affording it a passage through a volume of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"gas, if such a thing can be done in a practical manner.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,There are two more features upon which I think it necessary to dwell,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in connection with these experiments--the ""radiant state"" and the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"""non-striking vacuum.""","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Any one who has studied Crookes' work must have received the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"impression that the ""radiant state"" is a property of the gas","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,inseparably connected with an extremely high degree of exhaustion. But,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,it should be remembered that the phenomena observed in an exhausted,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,vessel are limited to the character and capacity of the apparatus,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"which is made use of. I think that in a bulb a molecule, or atom, does","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"not precisely move in a straight line because it meets no obstacle,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,but because the velocity imparted to it is sufficient to propel it in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"a sensibly straight line. The mean free path is one thing, but the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"velocity--the energy associated with the moving body--is another, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,under ordinary circumstances I believe that it is a mere question of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"potential or speed. A disruptive discharge coil, when the potential is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"pushed very far, excites phosphorescence and projects shadows, at","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"comparatively low degrees of exhaustion. In a lightning discharge,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,matter moves in straight lines as ordinary pressure when the mean free,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"path is exceedingly small, and frequently images of wires or other","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,metallic objects have been produced by the particles thrown off in,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,straight lines.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,[Illustration: FIG. 31.--BULB SHOWING RADIANT LIME STREAM AT LOW,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,EXHAUSTION.],"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,I have prepared a bulb to illustrate by an experiment the correctness,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,of these assertions. In a globe L (Fig. 31) I have mounted upon a lamp,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,filament f a piece of lime l. The lamp filament is connected with a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"wire which leads into the bulb, and the general construction of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"latter is as indicated in Fig. 19, before described. The bulb being","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"suspended from a wire connected to the terminal of the coil, and the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"latter being set to work, the lime piece l and the projecting parts of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the filament f are bombarded. The degree of exhaustion is just such,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,that with the potential the coil is capable of giving phosphorescence,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of the glass is produced, but disappears as soon as the vacuum is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"impaired. The lime containing moisture, and moisture being given off","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"as soon as heating occurs, the phosphorescence lasts only for a few","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"moments. When the lime has been sufficiently heated, enough moisture","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,has been given off to impair materially the vacuum of the bulb. As the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"bombardment goes on, one point of the lime piece is more heated than","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"other points, and the result is that finally practically all the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"discharge passes through that point which is intensely heated, and a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,white stream of lime particles (Fig. 31) then breaks forth from that,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"point. This stream is composed of ""radiant"" matter, yet the degree of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,exhaustion is low. But the particles move in straight lines because,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the velocity imparted to them is great, and this is due to three","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"causes--to the great electric density, the high temperature of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"small point, and the fact that the particles of the lime are easily","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,torn and thrown off--far more easily than those of carbon. With,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frequencies such as we are able to obtain, the particles are bodily","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,thrown off and projected to a considerable distance; but with,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,sufficiently high frequencies no such thing would occur: in such case,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,only a stress would spread or a vibration would be propagated through,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the bulb. It would be out of the question to reach any such frequency,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,on the assumption that the atoms move with the speed of light; but I,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,believe that such a thing is impossible; for this an enormous,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,potential would be required. With potentials which we are able to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"obtain, even with a disruptive discharge coil, the speed must be quite","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,insignificant.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"As to the ""non-striking vacuum,"" the point to be noted is that it can","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"occur only with low frequency impulses, and it is necessitated by the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,impossibility of carrying off enough energy with such impulses in high,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,vacuum since the few atoms which are around the terminal upon coming,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,in contact with the same are repelled and kept at a distance for a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"comparatively long period of time, and not enough work can be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,performed to render the effect perceptible to the eye. If the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"difference of potential between the terminals is raised, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,dielectric breaks down. But with very high frequency impulses there,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"is no necessity for such breaking down, since any amount of work can","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,be performed by continually agitating the atoms in the exhausted,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"vessel, provided the frequency is high enough. It is easy to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,reach--even with frequencies obtained from an alternator as here,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,used--a stage at which the discharge does not pass between two,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"electrodes in a narrow tube, each of these being connected to one of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the terminals of the coil, but it is difficult to reach a point at","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,which a luminous discharge would not occur around each electrode.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,A thought which naturally presents itself in connection with high,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frequency currents, is to make use of their powerful electro-dynamic","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,inductive action to produce light effects in a sealed glass globe. The,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,leading-in wire is one of the defects of the present incandescent,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"lamp, and if no other improvement were made, that imperfection at","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"least should be done away with. Following this thought, I have carried","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"on experiments in various directions, of which some were indicated in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,my former paper. I may here mention one or two more lines of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,experiment which have been followed up.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Many bulbs were constructed as shown in Fig. 32 and Fig. 33.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"In Fig. 32 a wide tube T was sealed to a smaller W-shaped tube U, of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,phosphorescent glass. In the tube T was placed a coil C of aluminium,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"wire, the ends of which were provided with small spheres t and t_1 of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"aluminium, and reached into the U tube. The tube T was slipped into a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,socket containing a primary coil through which usually the discharges,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of Leyden jars were directed, and the rarefied gas in the small U tube","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,was excited to strong luminosity by the high-tension currents induced,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,in the coil C. When Leyden jar discharges were used to induce currents,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"in the coil C, it was found necessary to pack the tube T tightly with","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"insulating powder, as a discharge would occur frequently between the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"turns of the coil, especially when the primary was thick and the air","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"gap, through which the jars discharged, large, and no little trouble","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,was experienced in this way.,"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,In Fig. 33 is illustrated another form of the bulb constructed. In,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"this case a tube T is sealed to a globe L. The tube contains a coil C,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the ends of which pass through two small glass tubes t and t_1, which","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,are sealed to the tube T. Two refractory buttons m and m_1 are mounted,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,on lamp filaments which are fastened to the ends of the wires passing,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,through the glass tubes t and t_1. Generally in bulbs made on this,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,plan the globe L communicated with the tube T. For this purpose the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,ends of the small tubes t and t_1 were just a trifle heated in the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"burner, merely to hold the wires, but not to interfere with the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"communication. The tube T, with the small tubes, wires through the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"same, and the refractory buttons m and m_1, was first prepared, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"then sealed to globe L, whereupon the coil C was slipped in and the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,connections made to its ends. The tube was then packed with insulating,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"powder, jamming the latter as tight as possible up to very nearly the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"end, then it was closed and only a small hole left through which the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"remainder of the powder was introduced, and finally the end of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,tube was closed. Usually in bulbs constructed as shown in Fig. 33 an,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,aluminium tube a was fastened to the upper end s of each of the tubes,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"t and t_1, in order to protect that end against the heat. The buttons","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,m and m_1 could be brought to any degree of incandescence by passing,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the discharges of Leyden jars around the coil C. In such bulbs with,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,two buttons a very curious effect is produced by the formation of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,shadows of each of the two buttons.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Another line of experiment, which has been assiduously followed, was","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to induce by electro-dynamic induction a current or luminous discharge,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,in an exhausted tube or bulb. This matter has received such able,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,treatment at the hands of Prof. J.J. Thomson that I could add but,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"little to what he has made known, even had I made it the special","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"subject of this lecture. Still, since experiences in this line have","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"gradually led me to the present views and results, a few words must be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,devoted here to this subject.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"It has occurred, no doubt, to many that as a vacuum tube is made","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"longer the electromotive force per unit length of the tube, necessary","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"to pass a luminous discharge through the latter, gets continually","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"smaller; therefore, if the exhausted tube be made long enough, even","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,with low frequencies a luminous discharge could be induced in such a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,tube closed upon itself. Such a tube might be placed around a ball or,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"on a ceiling, and at once a simple appliance capable of giving","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,considerable light would be obtained. But this would be an appliance,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,hard to manufacture and extremely unmanageable. It would not do to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"make the tube up of small lengths, because there would be with","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"ordinary frequencies considerable loss in the coatings, and besides,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"if coatings were used, it would be better to supply the current","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,directly to the tube by connecting the coatings to a transformer. But,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"even if all objections of such nature were removed, still, with low","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frequencies the light conversion itself would be inefficient, as I","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,have before stated. In using extremely high frequencies the length of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the secondary--in other words, the size of the vessel--can be reduced","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"as far as desired, and the efficiency of the light conversion is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"increased, provided that means are invented for efficiently obtaining","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"such high frequencies. Thus one is led, from theoretical and practical","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"considerations, to the use of high frequencies, and this means high","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,electromotive forces and small currents in the primary. When he works,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,with condenser charges--and they are the only means up to the present,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,known for reaching these extreme frequencies--he gets to electromotive,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,forces of several thousands of volts per turn of the primary. He,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,cannot multiply the electro-dynamic inductive effect by taking more,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"turns in the primary, for he arrives at the conclusion that the best","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,way is to work with one single turn--though he must sometimes depart,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,from this rule--and he must get along with whatever inductive effect,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,he can obtain with one turn. But before he has long experimented with,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the extreme frequencies required to set up in a small bulb an,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,electromotive force of several thousands of volts he realizes the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"great importance of electrostatic effects, and these effects grow","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,relatively to the electro-dynamic in significance as the frequency is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,increased.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Now, if anything is desirable in this case, it is to increase the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frequency, and this would make it still worse for the electro-dynamic","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"effects. On the other hand, it is easy to exalt the electrostatic","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"action as far as one likes by taking more turns on the secondary, or","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,combining self-induction and capacity to raise the potential. It,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"should also be remembered that, in reducing the current to the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"smallest value and increasing the potential, the electric impulses of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,high frequency can be more easily transmitted through a conductor.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,These and similar thoughts determined me to devote more attention to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the electrostatic phenomena, and to endeavor to produce potentials as","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"high as possible, and alternating as fast as they could be made to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,alternate. I then found that I could excite vacuum tubes at,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,considerable distance from a conductor connected to a properly,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"constructed coil, and that I could, by converting the oscillatory","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"current of a condenser to a higher potential, establish electrostatic","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"alternating fields which acted through the whole extent of a room,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,lighting up a tube no matter where it was held in space. I thought I,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"recognized that I had made a step in advance, and I have persevered in","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,this line; but I wish to say that I share with all lovers of science,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and progress the one and only desire--to reach a result of utility to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,men in any direction to which thought or experiment may lead me. I,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"think that this departure is the right one, for I cannot see, from the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,observation of the phenomena which manifest themselves as the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frequency is increased, what there would remain to act between two","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"circuits conveying, for instance, impulses of several hundred millions","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"per second, except electrostatic forces. Even with such trifling","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"frequencies the energy would be practically all potential, and my","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"conviction has grown strong that, to whatever kind of motion light may","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"be due, it is produced by tremendous electrostatic stresses vibrating","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,with extreme rapidity.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Of all these phenomena observed with currents, or electric impulses,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of high frequency, the most fascinating for an audience are certainly","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,those which are noted in an electrostatic field acting through,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"considerable distance, and the best an unskilled lecturer can do is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,to begin and finish with the exhibition of these singular effects. I,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"take a tube in the hand and move it about, and it is lighted wherever","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,I may hold it; throughout space the invisible forces act. But I may,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"take another tube and it might not light, the vacuum being very high.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"I excite it by means of a disruptive discharge coil, and now it will","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,light in the electrostatic field. I may put it away for a few weeks or,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"months, still it retains the faculty of being excited. What change","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,have I produced in the tube in the act of exciting it? If a motion,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"imparted to the atoms, it is difficult to perceive how it can persist","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,so long without being arrested by frictional losses; and if a strain,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"exerted in the dielectric, such as a simple electrification would","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"produce, it is easy to see how it may persist indefinitely, but very","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,difficult to understand why such a condition should aid the excitation,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,when we have to deal with potentials which are rapidly alternating.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Since I have exhibited these phenomena for the first time, I have","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"obtained some other interesting effects. For instance, I have produced","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the incandescence of a button, filament, or wire enclosed in a tube.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,To get to this result it was necessary to economize the energy which,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,is obtained from the field and direct most of it on the small body to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,be rendered incandescent. At the beginning the task appeared,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"difficult, but the experiences gathered permitted me to reach the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,result easily. In Fig. 34 and Fig. 35 two such tubes are illustrated,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"which are prepared for the occasion. In Fig. 34 a short tube T_1,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"sealed to another long tube T, is provided with a stem s, with a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,platinum wire sealed in the latter. A very thin lamp filament l is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"fastened to this wire, and connection to the outside is made through a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,thin copper wire w. The tube is provided with outside and inside,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"coatings, C and C_1 respectively, and is filled as far as the coatings","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"reach with conducting, and the space above with insulating powder.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,These coatings are merely used to enable me to perform two experiments,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"with the tube--namely, to produce the effect desired either by direct","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,connection of the body of the experimenter or of another body to the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"wire w, or by acting inductively through the glass. The stem s is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"provided with an aluminium tube a, for purposes before explained, and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,only a small part of the filament reaches out of this tube. By holding,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the tube T_1 anywhere in the electrostatic field the filament is,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,rendered incandescent.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,[Illustration: FIG. 34.--TUBE WITH FILAMENT RENDERED INCANDESCENT IN,"Tesla, Nikola"

13476,[Illustration: FIG. 35.--CROOKES' EXPERIMENT IN ELECTROSTATIC FIELD.],"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,A more interesting piece of apparatus is illustrated in Fig. 35. The,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"construction is the same as before, only instead of the lamp filament","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"a small platinum wire p, sealed in a stem s, and bent above it in a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"circle, is connected to the copper wire w, which is joined to an","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"inside coating C. A small stem s_1 is provided with a needle, on the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,point of which is arranged to rotate very freely a very light fan of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"mica v. To prevent the fan from falling out, a thin stem of glass g is","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,bent properly and fastened to the aluminium tube. When the glass tube,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,is held anywhere in the electrostatic field the platinum wire becomes,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"incandescent, and the mica vanes are rotated very fast.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Intense phosphorescence may be excited in a bulb by merely connecting,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"it to a plate within the field, and the plate need not be any larger","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,than an ordinary lamp shade. The phosphorescence excited with these,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,currents is incomparably more powerful than with ordinary apparatus. A,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"small phosphorescent bulb, when attached to a wire connected to a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"coil, emits sufficient light to allow reading ordinary print at a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,distance of five to six paces. It was of interest to see how some of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the phosphorescent bulbs of Professor Crookes would behave with these,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"currents, and he has had the kindness to lend me a few for the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"occasion. The effects produced are magnificent, especially by the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,sulphide of calcium and sulphide of zinc. From the disruptive,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,discharge coil they glow intensely merely by holding them in the hand,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,and connecting the body to the terminal of the coil.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"To whatever results investigations of this kind may lead, their chief","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,interest lies for the present in the possibilities they offer for the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,production of an efficient illuminating device. In no branch of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,electric industry is an advance more desired than in the manufacture,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of light. Every thinker, when considering the barbarous methods","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"employed, the deplorable losses incurred in our best systems of light","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"production, must have asked himself, What is likely to be the light of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the future? Is it to be an incandescent solid, as in the present lamp,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"or an incandescent gas, or a phosphorescent body, or something like a","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"burner, but incomparably more efficient?","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"There is little chance to perfect a gas burner; not, perhaps, because","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,human ingenuity has been bent upon that problem for centuries without,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,a radical departure having been made--though this argument is not,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,devoid of force-but because in a burner the higher vibrations can,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,never be reached except by passing through all the low ones. For how,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,is a flame produced unless by a fall of lifted weights? Such process,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"cannot be maintained without renewal, and renewal is repeated passing","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,from low to high vibrations. One way only seems to be open to improve,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"a burner, and that is by trying to reach higher degrees of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,incandescence. Higher incandescence is equivalent to a quicker,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"vibration; that means more light from the same material, and that,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"again, means more economy. In this direction some improvements have","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"been made, but the progress is hampered by many limitations.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Discarding, then, the burner, there remain the three ways first","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"mentioned, which are essentially electrical.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Suppose the light of the immediate future to be a solid rendered,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,incandescent by electricity. Would it not seem that it is better to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,employ a small button than a frail filament? From many considerations,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,it certainly must be concluded that a button is capable of a higher,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"economy, assuming, of course, the difficulties connected with the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,operation of such a lamp to be effectively overcome. But to light such,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,a lamp we require a high potential; and to get this economically we,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,must use high frequencies.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,Such considerations apply even more to the production of light by the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"incandescence of a gas, or by phosphorescence. In all cases we require","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,high frequencies and high potentials. These thoughts occurred to me a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,long time ago.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"Incidentally we gain, by the use of very high frequencies, many","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"advantages, such as a higher economy in the light production, the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"possibility of working with one lead, the possibility of doing away","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"with the leading-in wire, etc.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The question is, how far can we go with frequencies? Ordinary","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,conductors rapidly lose the facility of transmitting electric impulses,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,when the frequency is greatly increased. Assume the means for the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,production of impulses of very great frequency brought to the utmost,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"perfection, every one will naturally ask how to transmit them when the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,necessity arises. In transmitting such impulses through conductors we,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"must remember that we have to deal with _pressure_ and _flow_, in the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,ordinary interpretation of these terms. Let the pressure increase to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"an enormous value, and let the flow correspondingly diminish, then","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"such impulses--variations merely of pressure, as it were--can no doubt","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,be transmitted through a wire even if their frequency be many hundreds,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"of millions per second. It would, of course, be out of question to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"transmit such impulses through a wire immersed in a gaseous medium,","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,even if the wire were provided with a thick and excellent insulation,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,for most of the energy would be lost in molecular bombardment and,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,consequent heating. The end of the wire connected to the source would,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"be heated, and the remote end would receive but a trifling part of the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"energy supplied. The prime necessity, then, if such electric impulses","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"are to be used, is to find means to reduce as much as possible the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,dissipation.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"The first thought is, employ the thinnest possible wire surrounded by","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the thickest practicable insulation. The next thought is to employ,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,electrostatic screens. The insulation of the wire may be covered with,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,a thin conducting coating and the latter connected to the ground. But,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"this would not do, as then all the energy would pass through the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,conducting coating to the ground and nothing would get to the end of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the wire. If a ground connection is made it can only be made through a,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"conductor offering an enormous impedance, or though a condenser of","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"extremely small capacity. This, however, does not do away with other","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,difficulties.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,If the wave length of the impulses is much smaller than the length of,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the wire, then corresponding short waves will be sent up in the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"conducting coating, and it will be more or less the same as though the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,coating were directly connected to earth. It is therefore necessary to,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,cut up the coating in sections much shorter than the wave length. Such,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"an arrangement does not still afford a perfect screen, but it is ten","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,thousand times better than none. I think it preferable to cut up the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"conducting coating in small sections, even if the current waves be","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,much longer than the coating.,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"If a wire were provided with a perfect electrostatic screen, it would","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,be the same as though all objects were removed from it at infinite,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,distance. The capacity would then be reduced to the capacity of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"wire itself, which would be very small. It would then be possible to","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,send over the wire current vibrations of very high frequencies at,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,enormous distance without affecting greatly the character of the,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"vibrations. A perfect screen is of course out of the question, but I","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,believe that with a screen such as I have just described telephony,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,could be rendered practicable across the Atlantic. According to my,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"ideas, the gutta-percha covered wire should be provided with a third","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,conducting coating subdivided in sections. On the top of this should,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"be again placed a layer of gutta-percha and other insulation, and on","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,the top of the whole the armor. But such cables will not be,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"constructed, for ere long intelligence--transmitted without","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,wires--will throb through the earth like a pulse through a living,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"organism. The wonder is that, with the present state of knowledge and","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"the experiences gained, no attempt is being made to disturb the","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"electrostatic or magnetic condition of the earth, and transmit, if","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"nothing else, intelligence.","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,It has been my chief aim in presenting these results to point out,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"phenomena or features of novelty, and to advance ideas which I am","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,hopeful will serve as starting points of new departures. It has been,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,my chief desire this evening to entertain you with some novel,"Tesla, Nikola"
13476,"experiments. Your applause, so frequently and generously accorded, has","Tesla, Nikola"
13476,told me that I have succeeded.,"Tesla, Nikola"

14725,PREFACE,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"I wrote this Treatise during my sojourn in France twelve years ago,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and I communicated it in the year 1678 to the learned persons who then,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"composed the Royal Academy of Science, to the membership of which the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"King had done me the honour of calling, me. Several of that body who","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"are still alive will remember having been present when I read it, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,above the rest those amongst them who applied themselves particularly,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,to the study of Mathematics; of whom I cannot cite more than the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"celebrated gentlemen Cassini, Roemer, and De la Hire. And, although I","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"have since corrected and changed some parts, the copies which I had","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,made of it at that time may serve for proof that I have yet added,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,nothing to it save some conjectures touching the formation of Iceland,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Crystal, and a novel observation on the refraction of Rock Crystal. I","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,have desired to relate these particulars to make known how long I have,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"meditated the things which now I publish, and not for the purpose of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"detracting from the merit of those who, without having seen anything","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that I have written, may be found to have treated of like matters: as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"has in fact occurred to two eminent Geometricians, Messieurs Newton","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and Leibnitz, with respect to the Problem of the figure of glasses for","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,collecting rays when one of the surfaces is given.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,One may ask why I have so long delayed to bring this work to the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,light. The reason is that I wrote it rather carelessly in the Language,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"in which it appears, with the intention of translating it into Latin,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,so doing in order to obtain greater attention to the thing. After,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which I proposed to myself to give it out along with another Treatise,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"on Dioptrics, in which I explain the effects of Telescopes and those","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,things which belong more to that Science. But the pleasure of novelty,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"being past, I have put off from time to time the execution of this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"design, and I know not when I shall ever come to an end if it, being","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,often turned aside either by business or by some new study.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Considering which I have finally judged that it was better worth while,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to publish this writing, such as it is, than to let it run the risk,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"by waiting longer, of remaining lost.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,There will be seen in it demonstrations of those kinds which do not,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"produce as great a certitude as those of Geometry, and which even","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"differ much therefrom, since whereas the Geometers prove their","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Propositions by fixed and incontestable Principles, here the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Principles are verified by the conclusions to be drawn from them; the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,nature of these things not allowing of this being done otherwise.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,It is always possible to attain thereby to a degree of probability,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which very often is scarcely less than complete proof. To wit, when","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,things which have been demonstrated by the Principles that have been,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,assumed correspond perfectly to the phenomena which experiment has,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,brought under observation; especially when there are a great number of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"them, and further, principally, when one can imagine and foresee new","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"phenomena which ought to follow from the hypotheses which one employs,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and when one finds that therein the fact corresponds to our prevision.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,But if all these proofs of probability are met with in that which I,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"propose to discuss, as it seems to me they are, this ought to be a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,very strong confirmation of the success of my inquiry; and it must be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ill if the facts are not pretty much as I represent them. I would,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,believe then that those who love to know the Causes of things and who,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"are able to admire the marvels of Light, will find some satisfaction","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"in these various speculations regarding it, and in the new explanation","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of its famous property which is the main foundation of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,construction of our eyes and of those great inventions which extend so,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,vastly the use of them.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,I hope also that there will be some who by following these beginnings,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,will penetrate much further into this question than I have been able,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to do, since the subject must be far from being exhausted. This","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,appears from the passages which I have indicated where I leave certain,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"difficulties without having resolved them, and still more from matters","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which I have not touched at all, such as Luminous Bodies of several","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"sorts, and all that concerns Colours; in which no one until now can","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"boast of having succeeded. Finally, there remains much more to be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,investigated touching the nature of Light which I do not pretend to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"have disclosed, and I shall owe much in return to him who shall be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,able to supplement that which is here lacking to me in knowledge. The,"Huygens, Christiaan"

14725,NOTE BY THE TRANSLATOR,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Considering the great influence which this Treatise has exercised in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the development of the Science of Optics, it seems strange that two","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,centuries should have passed before an English edition of the work,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,appeared. Perhaps the circumstance is due to the mistaken zeal with,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which formerly everything that conflicted with the cherished ideas of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Newton was denounced by his followers. The Treatise on Light of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Huygens has, however, withstood the test of time: and even now the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,exquisite skill with which he applied his conception of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,propagation of waves of light to unravel the intricacies of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"phenomena of the double refraction of crystals, and of the refraction","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of the atmosphere, will excite the admiration of the student of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Optics. It is true that his wave theory was far from the complete,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,doctrine as subsequently developed by Thomas Young and Augustin,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Fresnel, and belonged rather to geometrical than to physical Optics.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"If Huygens had no conception of transverse vibrations, of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"principle of interference, or of the existence of the ordered sequence","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of waves in trains, he nevertheless attained to a remarkably clear","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,understanding of the principles of wave-propagation; and his,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,exposition of the subject marks an epoch in the treatment of Optical,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,problems. It has been needful in preparing this translation to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,exercise care lest one should import into the author's text ideas of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"subsequent date, by using words that have come to imply modern","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,conceptions. Hence the adoption of as literal a rendering as possible.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,A few of the author's terms need explanation. He uses the word,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"""refraction,"" for example, both for the phenomenon or process usually","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"so denoted, and for the result of that process: thus the refracted ray","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"he habitually terms ""the refraction"" of the incident ray. When a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"wave-front, or, as he terms it, a ""wave,"" has passed from some initial","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"position to a subsequent one, he terms the wave-front in its","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"subsequent position ""the continuation"" of the wave. He also speaks of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the envelope of a set of elementary waves, formed by coalescence of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"those elementary wave-fronts, as ""the termination"" of the wave; and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the elementary wave-fronts he terms ""particular"" waves. Owing to the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,circumstance that the French word _rayon_ possesses the double,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"signification of ray of light and radius of a circle, he avoids its","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"use in the latter sense and speaks always of the semi-diameter, not of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the radius. His speculations as to the ether, his suggestive views of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the structure of crystalline bodies, and his explanation of opacity,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"slight as they are, will possibly surprise the reader by their seeming","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,modernness. And none can read his investigation of the phenomena found,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,in Iceland spar without marvelling at his insight and sagacity.,"Huygens, Christiaan"

14725,ON RAYS PROPAGATED IN STRAIGHT LINES,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"As happens in all the sciences in which Geometry is applied to matter,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the demonstrations concerning Optics are founded on truths drawn from,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,experience. Such are that the rays of light are propagated in straight,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,lines; that the angles of reflexion and of incidence are equal; and,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that in refraction the ray is bent according to the law of sines, now","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"so well known, and which is no less certain than the preceding laws.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,The majority of those who have written touching the various parts of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Optics have contented themselves with presuming these truths. But,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"some, more inquiring, have desired to investigate the origin and the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"causes, considering these to be in themselves wonderful effects of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Nature. In which they advanced some ingenious things, but not however","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,such that the most intelligent folk do not wish for better and more,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,satisfactory explanations. Wherefore I here desire to propound what I,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"have meditated on the subject, so as to contribute as much as I can","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to the explanation of this department of Natural Science, which, not","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"without reason, is reputed to be one of its most difficult parts. I","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,recognize myself to be much indebted to those who were the first to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,begin to dissipate the strange obscurity in which these things were,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"enveloped, and to give us hope that they might be explained by","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"intelligible reasoning. But, on the other hand I am astonished also","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that even here these have often been willing to offer, as assured and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"demonstrative, reasonings which were far from conclusive. For I do not","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,find that any one has yet given a probable explanation of the first,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and most notable phenomena of light, namely why it is not propagated","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"except in straight lines, and how visible rays, coming from an","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"infinitude of diverse places, cross one another without hindering one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,another in any way.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"I shall therefore essay in this book, to give, in accordance with the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"principles accepted in the Philosophy of the present day, some clearer","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and more probable reasons, firstly of these properties of light","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,propagated rectilinearly; secondly of light which is reflected on,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,meeting other bodies. Then I shall explain the phenomena of those rays,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which are said to suffer refraction on passing through transparent,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,bodies of different sorts; and in this part I shall also explain the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,effects of the refraction of the air by the different densities of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Atmosphere.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Thereafter I shall examine the causes of the strange refraction of a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,certain kind of Crystal which is brought from Iceland. And finally I,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,shall treat of the various shapes of transparent and reflecting bodies,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,by which rays are collected at a point or are turned aside in various,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ways. From this it will be seen with what facility, following our new","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Theory, we find not only the Ellipses, Hyperbolas, and other curves","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which Mr. Des Cartes has ingeniously invented for this purpose; but,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,also those which the surface of a glass lens ought to possess when its,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"other surface is given as spherical or plane, or of any other figure","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that may be.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,It is inconceivable to doubt that light consists in the motion of some,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"sort of matter. For whether one considers its production, one sees","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that here upon the Earth it is chiefly engendered by fire and flame,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which contain without doubt bodies that are in rapid motion, since","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"they dissolve and melt many other bodies, even the most solid; or","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"whether one considers its effects, one sees that when light is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"collected, as by concave mirrors, it has the property of burning as a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"fire does, that is to say it disunites the particles of bodies. This","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"is assuredly the mark of motion, at least in the true Philosophy, in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which one conceives the causes of all natural effects in terms of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"mechanical motions. This, in my opinion, we must necessarily do, or","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,else renounce all hopes of ever comprehending anything in Physics.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"And as, according to this Philosophy, one holds as certain that the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,sensation of sight is excited only by the impression of some movement,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of a kind of matter which acts on the nerves at the back of our eyes,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,there is here yet one reason more for believing that light consists in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,a movement of the matter which exists between us and the luminous,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,body.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Further, when one considers the extreme speed with which light spreads","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"on every side, and how, when it comes from different regions, even","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"from those directly opposite, the rays traverse one another without","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"hindrance, one may well understand that when we see a luminous object,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"it cannot be by any transport of matter coming to us from this object,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,in the way in which a shot or an arrow traverses the air; for,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"assuredly that would too greatly impugn these two properties of light,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,especially the second of them. It is then in some other way that light,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,spreads; and that which can lead us to comprehend it is the knowledge,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which we have of the spreading of Sound in the air.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"We know that by means of the air, which is an invisible and impalpable","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"body, Sound spreads around the spot where it has been produced, by a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,movement which is passed on successively from one part of the air to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"another; and that the spreading of this movement, taking place equally","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"rapidly on all sides, ought to form spherical surfaces ever enlarging","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and which strike our ears. Now there is no doubt at all that light,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,also comes from the luminous body to our eyes by some movement,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"impressed on the matter which is between the two; since, as we have","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"already seen, it cannot be by the transport of a body which passes","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"from one to the other. If, in addition, light takes time for its","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,passage--which we are now going to examine--it will follow that this,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"movement, impressed on the intervening matter, is successive; and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"consequently it spreads, as Sound does, by spherical surfaces and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,waves: for I call them waves from their resemblance to those which are,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"seen to be formed in water when a stone is thrown into it, and which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"present a successive spreading as circles, though these arise from","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"another cause, and are only in a flat surface.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"To see then whether the spreading of light takes time, let us consider","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,first whether there are any facts of experience which can convince us,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to the contrary. As to those which can be made here on the Earth, by","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"striking lights at great distances, although they prove that light","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"takes no sensible time to pass over these distances, one may say with","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"good reason that they are too small, and that the only conclusion to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,be drawn from them is that the passage of light is extremely rapid.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Mr. Des Cartes, who was of opinion that it is instantaneous, founded","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"his views, not without reason, upon a better basis of experience,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"drawn from the Eclipses of the Moon; which, nevertheless, as I shall","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"show, is not at all convincing. I will set it forth, in a way a little","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"different from his, in order to make the conclusion more","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,comprehensible.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Let A be the place of the sun, BD a part of the orbit or annual path","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of the Earth: ABC a straight line which I suppose to meet the orbit of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the Moon, which is represented by the circle CD, at C.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Now if light requires time, for example one hour, to traverse the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"space which is between the Earth and the Moon, it will follow that the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Earth having arrived at B, the shadow which it casts, or the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"interruption of the light, will not yet have arrived at the point C,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,but will only arrive there an hour after. It will then be one hour,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"after, reckoning from the moment when the Earth was at B, that the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Moon, arriving at C, will be obscured: but this obscuration or","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,interruption of the light will not reach the Earth till after another,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,hour. Let us suppose that the Earth in these two hours will have,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"arrived at E. The Earth then, being at E, will see the Eclipsed Moon","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"at C, which it left an hour before, and at the same time will see the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"sun at A. For it being immovable, as I suppose with Copernicus, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the light moving always in straight lines, it must always appear where","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"it is. But one has always observed, we are told, that the eclipsed","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Moon appears at the point of the Ecliptic opposite to the Sun; and yet,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,here it would appear in arrear of that point by an amount equal to the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"angle GEC, the supplement of AEC. This, however, is contrary to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"experience, since the angle GEC would be very sensible, and about 33","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"degrees. Now according to our computation, which is given in the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Treatise on the causes of the phenomena of Saturn, the distance BA","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,between the Earth and the Sun is about twelve thousand diameters of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the Earth, and hence four hundred times greater than BC the distance","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of the Moon, which is 30 diameters. Then the angle ECB will be nearly","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"four hundred times greater than BAE, which is five minutes; namely,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the path which the earth travels in two hours along its orbit; and,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,thus the angle BCE will be nearly 33 degrees; and likewise the angle,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"CEG, which is greater by five minutes.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,But it must be noted that the speed of light in this argument has been,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,assumed such that it takes a time of one hour to make the passage from,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,here to the Moon. If one supposes that for this it requires only one,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"minute of time, then it is manifest that the angle CEG will only be 33","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"minutes; and if it requires only ten seconds of time, the angle will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,be less than six minutes. And then it will not be easy to perceive,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"anything of it in observations of the Eclipse; nor, consequently, will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,it be permissible to deduce from it that the movement of light is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,instantaneous.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,It is true that we are here supposing a strange velocity that would be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"a hundred thousand times greater than that of Sound. For Sound,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"according to what I have observed, travels about 180 Toises in the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"time of one Second, or in about one beat of the pulse. But this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,supposition ought not to seem to be an impossibility; since it is not,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"a question of the transport of a body with so great a speed, but of a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,successive movement which is passed on from some bodies to others. I,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"have then made no difficulty, in meditating on these things, in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"supposing that the emanation of light is accomplished with time,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"seeing that in this way all its phenomena can be explained, and that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,in following the contrary opinion everything is incomprehensible. For,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"it has always seemed tome that even Mr. Des Cartes, whose aim has been","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to treat all the subjects of Physics intelligibly, and who assuredly","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"has succeeded in this better than any one before him, has said nothing","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that is not full of difficulties, or even inconceivable, in dealing","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,with Light and its properties.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"But that which I employed only as a hypothesis, has recently received","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,great seemingness as an established truth by the ingenious proof of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Mr. Roemer which I am going here to relate, expecting him himself to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,give all that is needed for its confirmation. It is founded as is the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"preceding argument upon celestial observations, and proves not only","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that Light takes time for its passage, but also demonstrates how much","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"time it takes, and that its velocity is even at least six times","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,greater than that which I have just stated.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,For this he makes use of the Eclipses suffered by the little planets,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which revolve around Jupiter, and which often enter his shadow: and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"see what is his reasoning. Let A be the Sun, BCDE the annual orbit of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the Earth, F Jupiter, GN the orbit of the nearest of his Satellites,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,for it is this one which is more apt for this investigation than any,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of the other three, because of the quickness of its revolution. Let G","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"be this Satellite entering into the shadow of Jupiter, H the same","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Satellite emerging from the shadow.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Let it be then supposed, the Earth being at B some time before the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"last quadrature, that one has seen the said Satellite emerge from the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"shadow; it must needs be, if the Earth remains at the same place,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that, after 42-1/2 hours, one would again see a similar emergence,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"because that is the time in which it makes the round of its orbit, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"when it would come again into opposition to the Sun. And if the Earth,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"for instance, were to remain always at B during 30 revolutions of this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Satellite, one would see it again emerge from the shadow after 30","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,times 42-1/2 hours. But the Earth having been carried along during,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"this time to C, increasing thus its distance from Jupiter, it follows","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that if Light requires time for its passage the illumination of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,little planet will be perceived later at C than it would have been at,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"B, and that there must be added to this time of 30 times 42-1/2 hours","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that which the Light has required to traverse the space MC, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"difference of the spaces CH, BH. Similarly at the other quadrature","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"when the earth has come to E from D while approaching toward Jupiter,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the immersions of the Satellite ought to be observed at E earlier than,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,they would have been seen if the Earth had remained at D.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Now in quantities of observations of these Eclipses, made during ten","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"consecutive years, these differences have been found to be very","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"considerable, such as ten minutes and more; and from them it has been","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,concluded that in order to traverse the whole diameter of the annual,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"orbit KL, which is double the distance from here to the sun, Light","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,requires about 22 minutes of time.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,The movement of Jupiter in his orbit while the Earth passed from B to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"C, or from D to E, is included in this calculation; and this makes it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,evident that one cannot attribute the retardation of these,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"illuminations or the anticipation of the eclipses, either to any","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,irregularity occurring in the movement of the little planet or to its,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,eccentricity.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"If one considers the vast size of the diameter KL, which according to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"me is some 24 thousand diameters of the Earth, one will acknowledge","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the extreme velocity of Light. For, supposing that KL is no more than","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"22 thousand of these diameters, it appears that being traversed in 22","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"minutes this makes the speed a thousand diameters in one minute, that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"is 16-2/3 diameters in one second or in one beat of the pulse, which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,makes more than 11 hundred times a hundred thousand toises; since the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"diameter of the Earth contains 2,865 leagues, reckoned at 25 to the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"degree, and each each league is 2,282 Toises, according to the exact","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,measurement which Mr. Picard made by order of the King in 1669. But,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Sound, as I have said above, only travels 180 toises in the same time","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of one second: hence the velocity of Light is more than six hundred,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"thousand times greater than that of Sound. This, however, is quite","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"another thing from being instantaneous, since there is all the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,difference between a finite thing and an infinite. Now the successive,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"movement of Light being confirmed in this way, it follows, as I have","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"said, that it spreads by spherical waves, like the movement of Sound.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"But if the one resembles the other in this respect, they differ in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"many other things; to wit, in the first production of the movement","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which causes them; in the matter in which the movement spreads; and in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the manner in which it is propagated. As to that which occurs in the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"production of Sound, one knows that it is occasioned by the agitation","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"undergone by an entire body, or by a considerable part of one, which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,shakes all the contiguous air. But the movement of the Light must,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"originate as from each point of the luminous object, else we should","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"not be able to perceive all the different parts of that object, as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,will be more evident in that which follows. And I do not believe that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,this movement can be better explained than by supposing that all those,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of the luminous bodies which are liquid, such as flames, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"apparently the sun and the stars, are composed of particles which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,float in a much more subtle medium which agitates them with great,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"rapidity, and makes them strike against the particles of the ether","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which surrounds them, and which are much smaller than they. But I hold","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,also that in luminous solids such as charcoal or metal made red hot in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the fire, this same movement is caused by the violent agitation of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the particles of the metal or of the wood; those of them which are on,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the surface striking similarly against the ethereal matter. The,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"agitation, moreover, of the particles which engender the light ought","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,to be much more prompt and more rapid than is that of the bodies which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"cause sound, since we do not see that the tremors of a body which is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"giving out a sound are capable of giving rise to Light, even as the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,movement of the hand in the air is not capable of producing Sound.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Now if one examines what this matter may be in which the movement,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"coming from the luminous body is propagated, which I call Ethereal","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"matter, one will see that it is not the same that serves for the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,propagation of Sound. For one finds that the latter is really that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which we feel and which we breathe, and which being removed from any","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,place still leaves there the other kind of matter that serves to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,convey Light. This may be proved by shutting up a sounding body in a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,glass vessel from which the air is withdrawn by the machine which Mr.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Boyle has given us, and with which he has performed so many beautiful","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"experiments. But in doing this of which I speak, care must be taken to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"place the sounding body on cotton or on feathers, in such a way that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,it cannot communicate its tremors either to the glass vessel which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"encloses it, or to the machine; a precaution which has hitherto been","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,neglected. For then after having exhausted all the air one hears no,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Sound from the metal, though it is struck.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"One sees here not only that our air, which does not penetrate through","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"glass, is the matter by which Sound spreads; but also that it is not","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the same air but another kind of matter in which Light spreads; since,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,if the air is removed from the vessel the Light does not cease to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,traverse it as before.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,And this last point is demonstrated even more clearly by the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"celebrated experiment of Torricelli, in which the tube of glass from","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which the quicksilver has withdrawn itself, remaining void of air,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,transmits Light just the same as when air is in it. For this proves,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that a matter different from air exists in this tube, and that this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"matter must have penetrated the glass or the quicksilver, either one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"or the other, though they are both impenetrable to the air. And when,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"in the same experiment, one makes the vacuum after putting a little","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"water above the quicksilver, one concludes equally that the said","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"matter passes through glass or water, or through both.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,As regards the different modes in which I have said the movements of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Sound and of Light are communicated, one may sufficiently comprehend","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,how this occurs in the case of Sound if one considers that the air is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of such a nature that it can be compressed and reduced to a much,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,smaller space than that which it ordinarily occupies. And in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,proportion as it is compressed the more does it exert an effort to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"regain its volume; for this property along with its penetrability,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which remains notwithstanding its compression, seems to prove that it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,is made up of small bodies which float about and which are agitated,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,very rapidly in the ethereal matter composed of much smaller parts. So,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that the cause of the spreading of Sound is the effort which these,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"little bodies make in collisions with one another, to regain freedom","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,when they are a little more squeezed together in the circuit of these,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,waves than elsewhere.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"But the extreme velocity of Light, and other properties which it has,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"cannot admit of such a propagation of motion, and I am about to show","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"here the way in which I conceive it must occur. For this, it is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,needful to explain the property which hard bodies must possess to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,transmit movement from one to another.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"When one takes a number of spheres of equal size, made of some very","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"hard substance, and arranges them in a straight line, so that they","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"touch one another, one finds, on striking with a similar sphere","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"against the first of these spheres, that the motion passes as in an","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"instant to the last of them, which separates itself from the row,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,without one's being able to perceive that the others have been,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,stirred. And even that one which was used to strike remains motionless,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,with them. Whence one sees that the movement passes with an extreme,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"velocity which is the greater, the greater the hardness of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,substance of the spheres.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,But it is still certain that this progression of motion is not,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"instantaneous, but successive, and therefore must take time. For if","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the movement, or the disposition to movement, if you will have it so,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"did not pass successively through all these spheres, they would all","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"acquire the movement at the same time, and hence would all advance","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,together; which does not happen. For the last one leaves the whole row,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and acquires the speed of the one which was pushed. Moreover there are,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,experiments which demonstrate that all the bodies which we reckon of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the hardest kind, such as quenched steel, glass, and agate, act as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"springs and bend somehow, not only when extended as rods but also when","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,they are in the form of spheres or of other shapes. That is to say,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"they yield a little in themselves at the place where they are struck,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and immediately regain their former figure. For I have found that on,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,striking with a ball of glass or of agate against a large and quite,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"thick thick piece of the same substance which had a flat surface,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"slightly soiled with breath or in some other way, there remained round","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"marks, of smaller or larger size according as the blow had been weak","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,or strong. This makes it evident that these substances yield where,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"they meet, and spring back: and for this time must be required.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Now in applying this kind of movement to that which produces Light,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,there is nothing to hinder us from estimating the particles of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ether to be of a substance as nearly approaching to perfect hardness,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and possessing a springiness as prompt as we choose. It is not,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"necessary to examine here the causes of this hardness, or of that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"springiness, the consideration of which would lead us too far from our","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"subject. I will say, however, in passing that we may conceive that the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"particles of the ether, notwithstanding their smallness, are in turn","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,composed of other parts and that their springiness consists in the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,very rapid movement of a subtle matter which penetrates them from,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,every side and constrains their structure to assume such a disposition,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,as to give to this fluid matter the most overt and easy passage,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,possible. This accords with the explanation which Mr. Des Cartes gives,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"for the spring, though I do not, like him, suppose the pores to be in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the form of round hollow canals. And it must not be thought that in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"this there is anything absurd or impossible, it being on the contrary","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,quite credible that it is this infinite series of different sizes of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"corpuscles, having different degrees of velocity, of which Nature","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,makes use to produce so many marvellous effects.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,But though we shall ignore the true cause of springiness we still see,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that there are many bodies which possess this property; and thus there,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,is nothing strange in supposing that it exists also in little,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,invisible bodies like the particles of the Ether. Also if one wishes,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,to seek for any other way in which the movement of Light is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"successively communicated, one will find none which agrees better,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"with uniform progression, as seems to be necessary, than the property","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of springiness; because if this movement should grow slower in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"proportion as it is shared over a greater quantity of matter, in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"moving away from the source of the light, it could not conserve this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,great velocity over great distances. But by supposing springiness in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the ethereal matter, its particles will have the property of equally","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,rapid restitution whether they are pushed strongly or feebly; and thus,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the propagation of Light will always go on with an equal velocity.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,And it must be known that although the particles of the ether are not,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ranged thus in straight lines, as in our row of spheres, but","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"confusedly, so that one of them touches several others, this does not","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,hinder them from transmitting their movement and from spreading it,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,always forward. As to this it is to be remarked that there is a law of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"motion serving for this propagation, and verifiable by experiment. It","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"is that when a sphere, such as A here, touches several other similar","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spheres CCC, if it is struck by another sphere B in such a way as to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"exert an impulse against all the spheres CCC which touch it, it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"transmits to them the whole of its movement, and remains after that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,motionless like the sphere B. And without supposing that the ethereal,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,particles are of spherical form (for I see indeed no need to suppose,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,them so) one may well understand that this property of communicating,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,an impulse does not fail to contribute to the aforesaid propagation,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of movement.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Equality of size seems to be more necessary, because otherwise there","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ought to be some reflexion of movement backwards when it passes from a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"smaller particle to a larger one, according to the Laws of Percussion","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which I published some years ago.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"However, one will see hereafter that we have to suppose such an","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,equality not so much as a necessity for the propagation of light as,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,for rendering that propagation easier and more powerful; for it is not,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,beyond the limits of probability that the particles of the ether have,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"been made equal for a purpose so important as that of light, at least","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,in that vast space which is beyond the region of atmosphere and which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,seems to serve only to transmit the light of the Sun and the Stars.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,I have then shown in what manner one may conceive Light to spread,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"successively, by spherical waves, and how it is possible that this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,spreading is accomplished with as great a velocity as that which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,experiments and celestial observations demand. Whence it may be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,further remarked that although the particles are supposed to be in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,continual movement (for there are many reasons for this) the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,successive propagation of the waves cannot be hindered by this;,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,because the propagation consists nowise in the transport of those,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,particles but merely in a small agitation which they cannot help,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"communicating to those surrounding, notwithstanding any movement which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,may act on them causing them to be changing positions amongst,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,themselves.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,But we must consider still more particularly the origin of these,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"waves, and the manner in which they spread. And, first, it follows","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"from what has been said on the production of Light, that each little","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"region of a luminous body, such as the Sun, a candle, or a burning","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"coal, generates its own waves of which that region is the centre. Thus","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"in the flame of a candle, having distinguished the points A, B, C,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,concentric circles described about each of these points represent the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,waves which come from them. And one must imagine the same about every,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,point of the surface and of the part within the flame.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,But as the percussions at the centres of these waves possess no,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"regular succession, it must not be supposed that the waves themselves","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,follow one another at equal distances: and if the distances marked in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the figure appear to be such, it is rather to mark the progression of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,one and the same wave at equal intervals of time than to represent,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,several of them issuing from one and the same centre.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"After all, this prodigious quantity of waves which traverse one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,another without confusion and without effacing one another must not be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,deemed inconceivable; it being certain that one and the same particle,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of matter can serve for many waves coming from different sides or even,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"from contrary directions, not only if it is struck by blows which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,follow one another closely but even for those which act on it at the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,same instant. It can do so because the spreading of the movement is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,successive. This may be proved by the row of equal spheres of hard,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"matter, spoken of above. If against this row there are pushed from two","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"opposite sides at the same time two similar spheres A and D, one will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,see each of them rebound with the same velocity which it had in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"striking, yet the whole row will remain in its place, although the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,movement has passed along its whole length twice over. And if these,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"contrary movements happen to meet one another at the middle sphere, B,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"or at some other such as C, that sphere will yield and act as a spring","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"at both sides, and so will serve at the same instant to transmit these","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,two movements.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,But what may at first appear full strange and even incredible is that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the undulations produced by such small movements and corpuscles,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,should spread to such immense distances; as for example from the Sun,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,or from the Stars to us. For the force of these waves must grow feeble,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"in proportion as they move away from their origin, so that the action","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of each one in particular will without doubt become incapable of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,making itself felt to our sight. But one will cease to be astonished,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,by considering how at a great distance from the luminous body an,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"infinitude of waves, though they have issued from different points of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"this body, unite together in such a way that they sensibly compose one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"single wave only, which, consequently, ought to have enough force to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,make itself felt. Thus this infinite number of waves which originate,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"at the same instant from all points of a fixed star, big it may be as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the Sun, make practically only one single wave which may well have","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,force enough to produce an impression on our eyes. Moreover from each,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,luminous point there may come many thousands of waves in the smallest,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"imaginable time, by the frequent percussion of the corpuscles which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,strike the Ether at these points: which further contributes to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,rendering their action more sensible.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"There is the further consideration in the emanation of these waves,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that each particle of matter in which a wave spreads, ought not to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,communicate its motion only to the next particle which is in the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"straight line drawn from the luminous point, but that it also imparts","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,some of it necessarily to all the others which touch it and which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,oppose themselves to its movement. So it arises that around each,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,particle there is made a wave of which that particle is the centre.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Thus if DCF is a wave emanating from the luminous point A, which is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"its centre, the particle B, one of those comprised within the sphere","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"DCF, will have made its particular or partial wave KCL, which will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,touch the wave DCF at C at the same moment that the principal wave,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,emanating from the point A has arrived at DCF; and it is clear that it,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,will be only the region C of the wave KCL which will touch the wave,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"DCF, to wit, that which is in the straight line drawn through AB.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Similarly the other particles of the sphere DCF, such as _bb_, _dd_,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"etc., will each make its own wave. But each of these waves can be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"infinitely feeble only as compared with the wave DCF, to the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,composition of which all the others contribute by the part of their,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,surface which is most distant from the centre A.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"One sees, in addition, that the wave DCF is determined by the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,distance attained in a certain space of time by the movement which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"started from the point A; there being no movement beyond this wave,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"though there will be in the space which it encloses, namely in parts","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of the particular waves, those parts which do not touch the sphere","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,DCF. And all this ought not to seem fraught with too much minuteness,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"or subtlety, since we shall see in the sequel that all the properties","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of Light, and everything pertaining to its reflexion and its","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refraction, can be explained in principle by this means. This is a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,matter which has been quite unknown to those who hitherto have begun,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to consider the waves of light, amongst whom are Mr. Hooke in his","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"_Micrographia_, and Father Pardies, who, in a treatise of which he let","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"me see a portion, and which he was unable to complete as he died","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"shortly afterward, had undertaken to prove by these waves the effects","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of reflexion and refraction. But the chief foundation, which consists","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"in the remark I have just made, was lacking in his demonstrations; and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"for the rest he had opinions very different from mine, as may be will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,appear some day if his writing has been preserved.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,To come to the properties of Light. We remark first that each portion,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of a wave ought to spread in such a way that its extremities lie,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,always between the same straight lines drawn from the luminous point.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Thus the portion BG of the wave, having the luminous point A as its","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"centre, will spread into the arc CE bounded by the straight lines ABC,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,AGE. For although the particular waves produced by the particles,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"comprised within the space CAE spread also outside this space, they","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,yet do not concur at the same instant to compose a wave which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"terminates the movement, as they do precisely at the circumference","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"CE, which is their common tangent.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"And hence one sees the reason why light, at least if its rays are not","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"reflected or broken, spreads only by straight lines, so that it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,illuminates no object except when the path from its source to that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,object is open along such lines.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"For if, for example, there were an opening BG, limited by opaque","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"bodies BH, GI, the wave of light which issues from the point A will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"always be terminated by the straight lines AC, AE, as has just been","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,shown; the parts of the partial waves which spread outside the space,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ACE being too feeble to produce light there.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Now, however small we make the opening BG, there is always the same","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,reason causing the light there to pass between straight lines; since,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,this opening is always large enough to contain a great number of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"particles of the ethereal matter, which are of an inconceivable","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,smallness; so that it appears that each little portion of the wave,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,necessarily advances following the straight line which comes from the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,luminous point. Thus then we may take the rays of light as if they,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,were straight lines.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"It appears, moreover, by what has been remarked touching the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"feebleness of the particular waves, that it is not needful that all","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the particles of the Ether should be equal amongst themselves, though","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,equality is more apt for the propagation of the movement. For it is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,true that inequality will cause a particle by pushing against another,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,larger one to strive to recoil with a part of its movement; but it,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,will thereby merely generate backwards towards the luminous point some,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"partial waves incapable of causing light, and not a wave compounded of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,many as CE was.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Another property of waves of light, and one of the most marvellous,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,is that when some of them come from different or even from opposing,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"sides, they produce their effect across one another without any","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,hindrance. Whence also it comes about that a number of spectators may,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"view different objects at the same time through the same opening, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that two persons can at the same time see one another's eyes. Now,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,according to the explanation which has been given of the action of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"light, how the waves do not destroy nor interrupt one another when","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"they cross one another, these effects which I have just mentioned are","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,easily conceived. But in my judgement they are not at all easy to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"explain according to the views of Mr. Des Cartes, who makes Light to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,consist in a continuous pressure merely tending to movement. For this,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,pressure not being able to act from two opposite sides at the same,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"time, against bodies which have no inclination to approach one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"another, it is impossible so to understand what I have been saying","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"about two persons mutually seeing one another's eyes, or how two","Huygens, Christiaan"

14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ON REFLEXION,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Having explained the effects of waves of light which spread in a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"homogeneous matter, we will examine next that which happens to them on","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,encountering other bodies. We will first make evident how the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Reflexion of light is explained by these same waves, and why it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,preserves equality of angles.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Let there be a surface AB; plane and polished, of some metal, glass,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"or other body, which at first I will consider as perfectly uniform","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,(reserving to myself to deal at the end of this demonstration with the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"inequalities from which it cannot be exempt), and let a line AC,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"inclined to AD, represent a portion of a wave of light, the centre of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which is so distant that this portion AC may be considered as a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"straight line; for I consider all this as in one plane, imagining to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"myself that the plane in which this figure is, cuts the sphere of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,wave through its centre and intersects the plane AB at right angles.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,This explanation will suffice once for all.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"The piece C of the wave AC, will in a certain space of time advance as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"far as the plane AB at B, following the straight line CB, which may be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"supposed to come from the luminous centre, and which in consequence is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,perpendicular to AC. Now in this same space of time the portion A of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the same wave, which has been hindered from communicating its movement","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"beyond the plane AB, or at least partly so, ought to have continued","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"its movement in the matter which is above this plane, and this along a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"distance equal to CB, making its own partial spherical wave,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,according to what has been said above. Which wave is here represented,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"by the circumference SNR, the centre of which is A, and its","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,semi-diameter AN equal to CB.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"If one considers further the other pieces H of the wave AC, it appears","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that they will not only have reached the surface AB by straight lines,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"HK parallel to CB, but that in addition they will have generated in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the transparent air, from the centres K, K, K, particular spherical","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"waves, represented here by circumferences the semi-diameters of which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"are equal to KM, that is to say to the continuations of HK as far as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the line BG parallel to AC. But all these circumferences have as a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"common tangent the straight line BN, namely the same which is drawn","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"from B as a tangent to the first of the circles, of which A is the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"centre, and AN the semi-diameter equal to BC, as is easy to see.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,It is then the line BN (comprised between B and the point N where the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,perpendicular from the point A falls) which is as it were formed by,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"all these circumferences, and which terminates the movement which is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,made by the reflexion of the wave AC; and it is also the place where,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the movement occurs in much greater quantity than anywhere else.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Wherefore, according to that which has been explained, BN is the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,propagation of the wave AC at the moment when the piece C of it has,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,arrived at B. For there is no other line which like BN is a common,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"tangent to all the aforesaid circles, except BG below the plane AB;","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which line BG would be the propagation of the wave if the movement,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,could have spread in a medium homogeneous with that which is above the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,plane. And if one wishes to see how the wave AC has come successively,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to BN, one has only to draw in the same figure the straight lines KO","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"parallel to BN, and the straight lines KL parallel to AC. Thus one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,will see that the straight wave AC has become broken up into all the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"OKL parts successively, and that it has become straight again at NB.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Now it is apparent here that the angle of reflexion is made equal to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the angle of incidence. For the triangles ACB, BNA being rectangular","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and having the side AB common, and the side CB equal to NA, it follows","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that the angles opposite to these sides will be equal, and therefore","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"also the angles CBA, NAB. But as CB, perpendicular to CA, marks the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"direction of the incident ray, so AN, perpendicular to the wave BN,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,marks the direction of the reflected ray; hence these rays are equally,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,inclined to the plane AB.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"But in considering the preceding demonstration, one might aver that it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,is indeed true that BN is the common tangent of the circular waves in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the plane of this figure, but that these waves, being in truth","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spherical, have still an infinitude of similar tangents, namely all","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the straight lines which are drawn from the point B in the surface,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"generated by the straight line BN about the axis BA. It remains,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"therefore, to demonstrate that there is no difficulty herein: and by","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the same argument one will see why the incident ray and the reflected,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ray are always in one and the same plane perpendicular to the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"reflecting plane. I say then that the wave AC, being regarded only as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"a line, produces no light. For a visible ray of light, however narrow","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"it may be, has always some width, and consequently it is necessary, in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"representing the wave whose progression constitutes the ray, to put","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,instead of a line AC some plane figure such as the circle HC in the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"following figure, by supposing, as we have done, the luminous point to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"be infinitely distant. Now it is easy to see, following the preceding","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"demonstration, that each small piece of this wave HC having arrived at","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the plane AB, and there generating each one its particular wave, these","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"will all have, when C arrives at B, a common plane which will touch","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"them, namely a circle BN similar to CH; and this will be intersected","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,at its middle and at right angles by the same plane which likewise,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,intersects the circle CH and the ellipse AB.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,One sees also that the said spheres of the partial waves cannot have,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,any common tangent plane other than the circle BN; so that it will be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,this plane where there will be more reflected movement than anywhere,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"else, and which will therefore carry on the light in continuance from","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the wave CH.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,I have also stated in the preceding demonstration that the movement of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the piece A of the incident wave is not able to communicate itself,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"beyond the plane AB, or at least not wholly. Whence it is to be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,remarked that though the movement of the ethereal matter might,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"communicate itself partly to that of the reflecting body, this could","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"in nothing alter the velocity of progression of the waves, on which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the angle of reflexion depends. For a slight percussion ought to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,generate waves as rapid as strong percussion in the same matter. This,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"comes about from the property of bodies which act as springs, of which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,we have spoken above; namely that whether compressed little or much,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,they recoil in equal times. Equally so in every reflexion of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"light, against whatever body it may be, the angles of reflexion and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,incidence ought to be equal notwithstanding that the body might be of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,such a nature that it takes away a portion of the movement made by the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,incident light. And experiment shows that in fact there is no polished,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,body the reflexion of which does not follow this rule.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,But the thing to be above all remarked in our demonstration is that it,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,does not require that the reflecting surface should be considered as a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"uniform plane, as has been supposed by all those who have tried to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,explain the effects of reflexion; but only an evenness such as may be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,attained by the particles of the matter of the reflecting body being,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,set near to one another; which particles are larger than those of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ethereal matter, as will appear by what we shall say in treating of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the transparency and opacity of bodies. For the surface consisting,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"thus of particles put together, and the ethereal particles being","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"above, and smaller, it is evident that one could not demonstrate the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,equality of the angles of incidence and reflexion by similitude to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that which happens to a ball thrown against a wall, of which writers","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"have always made use. In our way, on the other hand, the thing is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,explained without difficulty. For the smallness of the particles of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"quicksilver, for example, being such that one must conceive millions","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of them, in the smallest visible surface proposed, arranged like a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,heap of grains of sand which has been flattened as much as it is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"capable of being, this surface then becomes for our purpose as even","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"as a polished glass is: and, although it always remains rough with","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,respect to the particles of the Ether it is evident that the centres,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of all the particular spheres of reflexion, of which we have spoken,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"are almost in one uniform plane, and that thus the common tangent can","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,fit to them as perfectly as is requisite for the production of light.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"And this alone is requisite, in our method of demonstration, to cause","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,equality of the said angles without the remainder of the movement,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,reflected from all parts being able to produce any contrary effect.,"Huygens, Christiaan"

14725,CHAPTER III,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ON REFRACTION,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,In the same way as the effects of Reflexion have been explained by,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"waves of light reflected at the surface of polished bodies, we will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,explain transparency and the phenomena of refraction by waves which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spread within and across diaphanous bodies, both solids, such as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"glass, and liquids, such as water, oils, etc. But in order that it may","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,not seem strange to suppose this passage of waves in the interior of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"these bodies, I will first show that one may conceive it possible in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,more than one mode.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"First, then, if the ethereal matter cannot penetrate transparent","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"bodies at all, their own particles would be able to communicate","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"successively the movement of the waves, the same as do those of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Ether, supposing that, like those, they are of a nature to act as a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,spring. And this is easy to conceive as regards water and other,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"transparent liquids, they being composed of detached particles. But it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,may seem more difficult as regards glass and other transparent and,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"hard bodies, because their solidity does not seem to permit them to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"receive movement except in their whole mass at the same time. This,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"however, is not necessary because this solidity is not such as it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"appears to us, it being probable rather that these bodies are composed","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of particles merely placed close to one another and held together by,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"some pressure from without of some other matter, and by the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,irregularity of their shapes. For primarily their rarity is shown by,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the facility with which there passes through them the matter of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"vortices of the magnet, and that which causes gravity. Further, one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,cannot say that these bodies are of a texture similar to that of a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"sponge or of light bread, because the heat of the fire makes them flow","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and thereby changes the situation of the particles amongst themselves.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"It remains then that they are, as has been said, assemblages of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,particles which touch one another without constituting a continuous,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"solid. This being so, the movement which these particles receive to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"carry on the waves of light, being merely communicated from some of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"them to others, without their going for that purpose out of their","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"places or without derangement, it may very well produce its effect","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,without prejudicing in any way the apparent solidity of the compound.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"By pressure from without, of which I have spoken, must not be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"understood that of the air, which would not be sufficient, but that of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"some other more subtle matter, a pressure which I chanced upon by","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"experiment long ago, namely in the case of water freed from air, which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"remains suspended in a tube open at its lower end, notwithstanding","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that the air has been removed from the vessel in which this tube is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,enclosed.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,One can then in this way conceive of transparency in a solid without,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,any necessity that the ethereal matter which serves for light should,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"pass through it, or that it should find pores in which to insinuate","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,itself. But the truth is that this matter not only passes through,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"solids, but does so even with great facility; of which the experiment","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of Torricelli, above cited, is already a proof. Because on the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"quicksilver and the water quitting the upper part of the glass tube,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"it appears that it is immediately filled with ethereal matter, since","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,light passes across it. But here is another argument which proves this,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ready penetrability, not only in transparent bodies but also in all","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,others.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"When light passes across a hollow sphere of glass, closed on all","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"sides, it is certain that it is full of ethereal matter, as much as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the spaces outside the sphere. And this ethereal matter, as has been","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"shown above, consists of particles which just touch one another. If","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,then it were enclosed in the sphere in such a way that it could not,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"get out through the pores of the glass, it would be obliged to follow","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the movement of the sphere when one changes its place: and it would,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,require consequently almost the same force to impress a certain,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"velocity on this sphere, when placed on a horizontal plane, as if it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,were full of water or perhaps of quicksilver: because every body,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"resists the velocity of the motion which one would give to it, in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"proportion to the quantity of matter which it contains, and which is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,obliged to follow this motion. But on the contrary one finds that the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,sphere resists the impress of movement only in proportion to the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,quantity of matter of the glass of which it is made. Then it must be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that the ethereal matter which is inside is not shut up, but flows","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,through it with very great freedom. We shall demonstrate hereafter,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that by this process the same penetrability may be inferred also as,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,relating to opaque bodies.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"The second mode then of explaining transparency, and one which appears","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"more probably true, is by saying that the waves of light are carried","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"on in the ethereal matter, which continuously occupies the interstices","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,or pores of transparent bodies. For since it passes through them,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"continuously and freely, it follows that they are always full of it.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,And one may even show that these interstices occupy much more space,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,than the coherent particles which constitute the bodies. For if what,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,we have just said is true: that force is required to impress a certain,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,horizontal velocity on bodies in proportion as they contain coherent,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,matter; and if the proportion of this force follows the law of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"weights, as is confirmed by experiment, then the quantity of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,constituent matter of bodies also follows the proportion of their,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,weights. Now we see that water weighs only one fourteenth part as much,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,as an equal portion of quicksilver: therefore the matter of the water,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,does not occupy the fourteenth part of the space which its mass,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"obtains. It must even occupy much less of it, since quicksilver is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"less heavy than gold, and the matter of gold is by no means dense, as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,follows from the fact that the matter of the vortices of the magnet,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and of that which is the cause of gravity pass very freely through it.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,But it may be objected here that if water is a body of so great,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"rarity, and if its particles occupy so small a portion of the space of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"its apparent bulk, it is very strange how it yet resists Compression","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,so strongly without permitting itself to be condensed by any force,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which one has hitherto essayed to employ, preserving even its entire","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,liquidity while subjected to this pressure.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"This is no small difficulty. It may, however, be resolved by saying","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that the very violent and rapid motion of the subtle matter which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"renders water liquid, by agitating the particles of which it is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"composed, maintains this liquidity in spite of the pressure which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,hitherto any one has been minded to apply to it.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"The rarity of transparent bodies being then such as we have said, one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,easily conceives that the waves might be carried on in the ethereal,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"matter which fills the interstices of the particles. And, moreover,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,one may believe that the progression of these waves ought to be a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"little slower in the interior of bodies, by reason of the small","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,detours which the same particles cause. In which different velocity of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,light I shall show the cause of refraction to consist.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Before doing so, I will indicate the third and last mode in which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,transparency may be conceived; which is by supposing that the movement,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of the waves of light is transmitted indifferently both in the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,particles of the ethereal matter which occupy the interstices of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"bodies, and in the particles which compose them, so that the movement","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,passes from one to the other. And it will be seen hereafter that this,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,hypothesis serves excellently to explain the double refraction of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,certain transparent bodies.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Should it be objected that if the particles of the ether are smaller,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,than those of transparent bodies (since they pass through their,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"intervals), it would follow that they can communicate to them but","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"little of their movement, it may be replied that the particles of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"these bodies are in turn composed of still smaller particles, and so","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,it will be these secondary particles which will receive the movement,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,from those of the ether.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Furthermore, if the particles of transparent bodies have a recoil a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"little less prompt than that of the ethereal particles, which nothing","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"hinders us from supposing, it will again follow that the progression","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of the waves of light will be slower in the interior of such bodies,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,than it is outside in the ethereal matter.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,All this I have found as most probable for the mode in which the waves,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of light pass across transparent bodies. To which it must further be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,added in what respect these bodies differ from those which are opaque;,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and the more so since it might seem because of the easy penetration of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"bodies by the ethereal matter, of which mention has been made, that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,there would not be any body that was not transparent. For by the same,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,reasoning about the hollow sphere which I have employed to prove the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,smallness of the density of glass and its easy penetrability by the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ethereal matter, one might also prove that the same penetrability","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,obtains for metals and for every other sort of body. For this sphere,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"being for example of silver, it is certain that it contains some of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the ethereal matter which serves for light, since this was there as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"well as in the air when the opening of the sphere was closed. Yet,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"being closed and placed upon a horizontal plane, it resists the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"movement which one wishes to give to it, merely according to the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"quantity of silver of which it is made; so that one must conclude, as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"above, that the ethereal matter which is enclosed does not follow the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"movement of the sphere; and that therefore silver, as well as glass,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,is very easily penetrated by this matter. Some of it is therefore,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,present continuously and in quantities between the particles of silver,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and of all other opaque bodies: and since it serves for the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,propagation of light it would seem that these bodies ought also to be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"transparent, which however is not the case.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Whence then, one will say, does their opacity come? Is it because the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"particles which compose them are soft; that is to say, these particles","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"being composed of others that are smaller, are they capable of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,changing their figure on receiving the pressure of the ethereal,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"particles, the motion of which they thereby damp, and so hinder the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,continuance of the waves of light? That cannot be: for if the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"particles of the metals are soft, how is it that polished silver and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,mercury reflect light so strongly? What I find to be most probable,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"herein, is to say that metallic bodies, which are almost the only","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"really opaque ones, have mixed amongst their hard particles some soft","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ones; so that some serve to cause reflexion and the others to hinder,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"transparency; while, on the other hand, transparent bodies contain","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"only hard particles which have the faculty of recoil, and serve","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,together with those of the ethereal matter for the propagation of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"waves of light, as has been said.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Let us pass now to the explanation of the effects of Refraction,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"assuming, as we have done, the passage of waves of light through","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"transparent bodies, and the diminution of velocity which these same","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,waves suffer in them.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"The chief property of Refraction is that a ray of light, such as AB,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"being in the air, and falling obliquely upon the polished surface of a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"transparent body, such as FG, is broken at the point of incidence B,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,in such a way that with the straight line DBE which cuts the surface,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,perpendicularly it makes an angle CBE less than ABD which it made with,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the same perpendicular when in the air. And the measure of these,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"angles is found by describing, about the point B, a circle which cuts","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the radii AB, BC. For the perpendiculars AD, CE, let fall from the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"points of intersection upon the straight line DE, which are called the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Sines of the angles ABD, CBE, have a certain ratio between themselves;","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which ratio is always the same for all inclinations of the incident,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ray, at least for a given transparent body. This ratio is, in glass,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,very nearly as 3 to 2; and in water very nearly as 4 to 3; and is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,likewise different in other diaphanous bodies.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Another property, similar to this, is that the refractions are","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,reciprocal between the rays entering into a transparent body and those,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which are leaving it. That is to say that if the ray AB in entering,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the transparent body is refracted into BC, then likewise CB being","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"taken as a ray in the interior of this body will be refracted, on","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"passing out, into BA.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,To explain then the reasons of these phenomena according to our,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"principles, let AB be the straight line which represents a plane","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,surface bounding the transparent substances which lie towards C and,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"towards N. When I say plane, that does not signify a perfect evenness,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"but such as has been understood in treating of reflexion, and for the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"same reason. Let the line AC represent a portion of a wave of light,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the centre of which is supposed so distant that this portion may be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"considered as a straight line. The piece C, then, of the wave AC, will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,in a certain space of time have advanced as far as the plane AB,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"following the straight line CB, which may be imagined as coming from","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the luminous centre, and which consequently will cut AC at right","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,angles. Now in the same time the piece A would have come to G along,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the straight line AG, equal and parallel to CB; and all the portion of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,wave AC would be at GB if the matter of the transparent body,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,transmitted the movement of the wave as quickly as the matter of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Ether. But let us suppose that it transmits this movement less,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"quickly, by one-third, for instance. Movement will then be spread from","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the point A, in the matter of the transparent body through a distance","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"equal to two-thirds of CB, making its own particular spherical wave","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,according to what has been said before. This wave is then represented,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"by the circumference SNR, the centre of which is A, and its","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,semi-diameter equal to two-thirds of CB. Then if one considers in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"order the other pieces H of the wave AC, it appears that in the same","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,time that the piece C reaches B they will not only have arrived at the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"surface AB along the straight lines HK parallel to CB, but that, in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"addition, they will have generated in the diaphanous substance from","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the centres K, partial waves, represented here by circumferences the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"semi-diameters of which are equal to two-thirds of the lines KM, that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"is to say, to two-thirds of the prolongations of HK down to the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,straight line BG; for these semi-diameters would have been equal to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,entire lengths of KM if the two transparent substances had been of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,same penetrability.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Now all these circumferences have for a common tangent the straight,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,line BN; namely the same line which is drawn as a tangent from the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,point B to the circumference SNR which we considered first. For it is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"easy to see that all the other circumferences will touch the same BN,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"from B up to the point of contact N, which is the same point where AN","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,falls perpendicularly on BN.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"It is then BN, which is formed by small arcs of these circumferences,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which terminates the movement that the wave AC has communicated within,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the transparent body, and where this movement occurs in much greater","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"amount than anywhere else. And for that reason this line, in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"accordance with what has been said more than once, is the propagation","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of the wave AC at the moment when its piece C has reached B. For there,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"is no other line below the plane AB which is, like BN, a common","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,tangent to all these partial waves. And if one would know how the wave,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"AC has come progressively to BN, it is necessary only to draw in the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"same figure the straight lines KO parallel to BN, and all the lines KL","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"parallel to AC. Thus one will see that the wave CA, from being a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"straight line, has become broken in all the positions LKO","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"successively, and that it has again become a straight line at BN. This","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"being evident by what has already been demonstrated, there is no need","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,to explain it further.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Now, in the same figure, if one draws EAF, which cuts the plane AB at","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"right angles at the point A, since AD is perpendicular to the wave AC,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"it will be DA which will mark the ray of incident light, and AN which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"was perpendicular to BN, the refracted ray: since the rays are nothing","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,else than the straight lines along which the portions of the waves,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,advance.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Whence it is easy to recognize this chief property of refraction,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,namely that the Sine of the angle DAE has always the same ratio to the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Sine of the angle NAF, whatever be the inclination of the ray DA: and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that this ratio is the same as that of the velocity of the waves in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the transparent substance which is towards AE to their velocity in the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"transparent substance towards AF. For, considering AB as the radius of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"a circle, the Sine of the angle BAC is BC, and the Sine of the angle","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ABN is AN. But the angle BAC is equal to DAE, since each of them added","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to CAE makes a right angle. And the angle ABN is equal to NAF, since","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,each of them with BAN makes a right angle. Then also the Sine of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,angle DAE is to the Sine of NAF as BC is to AN. But the ratio of BC to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,AN was the same as that of the velocities of light in the substance,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which is towards AE and in that which is towards AF; therefore also,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the Sine of the angle DAE will be to the Sine of the angle NAF the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,same as the said velocities of light.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"To see, consequently, what the refraction will be when the waves of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,light pass into a substance in which the movement travels more quickly,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,than in that from which they emerge (let us again assume the ratio of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"3 to 2), it is only necessary to repeat all the same construction and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"demonstration which we have just used, merely substituting everywhere","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"3/2 instead of 2/3. And it will be found by the same reasoning, in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"this other figure, that when the piece C of the wave AC shall have","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"reached the surface AB at B, all the portions of the wave AC will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"have advanced as far as BN, so that BC the perpendicular on AC is to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,AN the perpendicular on BN as 2 to 3. And there will finally be this,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,same ratio of 2 to 3 between the Sine of the angle BAD and the Sine of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the angle FAN.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Hence one sees the reciprocal relation of the refractions of the ray,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,on entering and on leaving one and the same transparent body: namely,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that if NA falling on the external surface AB is refracted into the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"direction AD, so the ray AD will be refracted on leaving the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,transparent body into the direction AN.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,One sees also the reason for a noteworthy accident which happens in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"this refraction: which is this, that after a certain obliquity of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"incident ray DA, it begins to be quite unable to penetrate into the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,other transparent substance. For if the angle DAQ or CBA is such that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"in the triangle ACB, CB is equal to 2/3 of AB, or is greater, then AN","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"cannot form one side of the triangle ANB, since it becomes equal to or","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,greater than AB: so that the portion of wave BN cannot be found,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"anywhere, neither consequently can AN, which ought to be perpendicular","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,to it. And thus the incident ray DA does not then pierce the surface,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,AB.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"When the ratio of the velocities of the waves is as two to three, as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"in our example, which is that which obtains for glass and air, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,angle DAQ must be more than 48 degrees 11 minutes in order that the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ray DA may be able to pass by refraction. And when the ratio of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"velocities is as 3 to 4, as it is very nearly in water and air, this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,angle DAQ must exceed 41 degrees 24 minutes. And this accords,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,perfectly with experiment.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,But it might here be asked: since the meeting of the wave AC against,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the surface AB ought to produce movement in the matter which is on the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"other side, why does no light pass there? To which the reply is easy","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,if one remembers what has been said before. For although it generates,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,an infinitude of partial waves in the matter which is at the other,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"side of AB, these waves never have a common tangent line (either","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,straight or curved) at the same moment; and so there is no line,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"terminating the propagation of the wave AC beyond the plane AB, nor","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,any place where the movement is gathered together in sufficiently,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,great quantity to produce light. And one will easily see the truth of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"this, namely that CB being larger than 2/3 of AB, the waves excited","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,beyond the plane AB will have no common tangent if about the centres K,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,one then draws circles having radii equal to 3/2 of the lengths LB to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which they correspond. For all these circles will be enclosed in one,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,another and will all pass beyond the point B.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Now it is to be remarked that from the moment when the angle DAQ is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,smaller than is requisite to permit the refracted ray DA to pass into,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the other transparent substance, one finds that the interior reflexion","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which occurs at the surface AB is much augmented in brightness, as is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,easy to realize by experiment with a triangular prism; and for this,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,our theory can afford this reason. When the angle DAQ is still large,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"enough to enable the ray DA to pass, it is evident that the light from","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the portion AC of the wave is collected in a minimum space when it,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,reaches BN. It appears also that the wave BN becomes so much the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,smaller as the angle CBA or DAQ is made less; until when the latter is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"diminished to the limit indicated a little previously, this wave BN is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"collected together always at one point. That is to say, that when the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"piece C of the wave AC has then arrived at B, the wave BN which is the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,propagation of AC is entirely reduced to the same point B. Similarly,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"when the piece H has reached K, the part AH is entirely reduced to the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,same point K. This makes it evident that in proportion as the wave CA,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"comes to meet the surface AB, there occurs a great quantity of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,movement along that surface; which movement ought also to spread,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,within the transparent body and ought to have much re-enforced the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,partial waves which produce the interior reflexion against the surface,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"AB, according to the laws of reflexion previously explained.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,And because a slight diminution of the angle of incidence DAQ causes,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the wave BN, however great it was, to be reduced to zero, (for this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"angle being 49 degrees 11 minutes in the glass, the angle BAN is still","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"11 degrees 21 minutes, and the same angle being reduced by one degree","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"only the angle BAN is reduced to zero, and so the wave BN reduced to a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,point) thence it comes about that the interior reflexion from being,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"obscure becomes suddenly bright, so soon as the angle of incidence is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,such that it no longer gives passage to the refraction.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Now as concerns ordinary external reflexion, that is to say which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,occurs when the angle of incidence DAQ is still large enough to enable,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the refracted ray to penetrate beyond the surface AB, this reflexion","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,should occur against the particles of the substance which touches the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,transparent body on its outside. And it apparently occurs against the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,particles of the air or others mingled with the ethereal particles and,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,larger than they. So on the other hand the external reflexion of these,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"bodies occurs against the particles which compose them, and which are","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"also larger than those of the ethereal matter, since the latter flows","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,in their interstices. It is true that there remains here some,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,difficulty in those experiments in which this interior reflexion,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"occurs without the particles of air being able to contribute to it, as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,in vessels or tubes from which the air has been extracted.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Experience, moreover, teaches us that these two reflexions are of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"nearly equal force, and that in different transparent bodies they are","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,so much the stronger as the refraction of these bodies is the greater.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Thus one sees manifestly that the reflexion of glass is stronger than,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that of water, and that of diamond stronger than that of glass.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,I will finish this theory of refraction by demonstrating a remarkable,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"proposition which depends on it; namely, that a ray of light in order","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to go from one point to another, when these points are in different","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"media, is refracted in such wise at the plane surface which joins","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,these two media that it employs the least possible time: and exactly,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the same happens in the case of reflexion against a plane surface. Mr.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Fermat was the first to propound this property of refraction, holding","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"with us, and directly counter to the opinion of Mr. Des Cartes, that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,light passes more slowly through glass and water than through air.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"But he assumed besides this a constant ratio of Sines, which we have","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"just proved by these different degrees of velocity alone: or rather,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"what is equivalent, he assumed not only that the velocities were","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,different but that the light took the least time possible for its,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"passage, and thence deduced the constant ratio of the Sines. His","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"demonstration, which may be seen in his printed works, and in the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"volume of letters of Mr. Des Cartes, is very long; wherefore I give","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,here another which is simpler and easier.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Let KF be the plane surface; A the point in the medium which the light,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"traverses more easily, as the air; C the point in the other which is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"more difficult to penetrate, as water. And suppose that a ray has come","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"from A, by B, to C, having been refracted at B according to the law","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"demonstrated a little before; that is to say that, having drawn PBQ,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which cuts the plane at right angles, let the sine of the angle ABP","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,have to the sine of the angle CBQ the same ratio as the velocity of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,light in the medium where A is to the velocity of light in the medium,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,where C is. It is to be shown that the time of passage of light along,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"AB and BC taken together, is the shortest that can be. Let us assume","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that it may have come by other lines, and, in the first place, along","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"AF, FC, so that the point of refraction F may be further from B than","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the point A; and let AO be a line perpendicular to AB, and FO parallel","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to AB; BH perpendicular to FO, and FG to BC.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Since then the angle HBF is equal to PBA, and the angle BFG equal to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"QBC, it follows that the sine of the angle HBF will also have the same","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ratio to the sine of BFG, as the velocity of light in the medium A is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,to its velocity in the medium C. But these sines are the straight,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"lines HF, BG, if we take BF as the semi-diameter of a circle. Then","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"these lines HF, BG, will bear to one another the said ratio of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"velocities. And, therefore, the time of the light along HF, supposing","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that the ray had been OF, would be equal to the time along BG in the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,interior of the medium C. But the time along AB is equal to the time,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"along OH; therefore the time along OF is equal to the time along AB,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,BG. Again the time along FC is greater than that along GC; then the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,time along OFC will be longer than that along ABC. But AF is longer,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"than OF, then the time along AFC will by just so much more exceed the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,time along ABC.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Now let us assume that the ray has come from A to C along AK, KC; the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,point of refraction K being nearer to A than the point B is; and let,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"CN be the perpendicular upon BC, KN parallel to BC: BM perpendicular","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"upon KN, and KL upon BA.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Here BL and KM are the sines of angles BKL, KBM; that is to say, of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the angles PBA, QBC; and therefore they are to one another as the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,velocity of light in the medium A is to the velocity in the medium C.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Then the time along LB is equal to the time along KM; and since the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"time along BC is equal to the time along MN, the time along LBC will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,be equal to the time along KMN. But the time along AK is longer than,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that along AL: hence the time along AKN is longer than that along ABC.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"And KC being longer than KN, the time along AKC will exceed, by as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"much more, the time along ABC. Hence it appears that the time along","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ABC is the shortest possible; which was to be proven.,"Huygens, Christiaan"

14725,CHAPTER IV,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ON THE REFRACTION OF THE AIR,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,We have shown how the movement which constitutes light spreads by,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,spherical waves in any homogeneous matter. And it is evident that when,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the matter is not homogeneous, but of such a constitution that the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,movement is communicated in it more rapidly toward one side than,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"toward another, these waves cannot be spherical: but that they must","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,acquire their figure according to the different distances over which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the successive movement passes in equal times.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,It is thus that we shall in the first place explain the refractions,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which occur in the air, which extends from here to the clouds and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,beyond. The effects of which refractions are very remarkable; for by,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,them we often see objects which the rotundity of the Earth ought,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"otherwise to hide; such as Islands, and the tops of mountains when one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,is at sea. Because also of them the Sun and the Moon appear as risen,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"before in fact they have, and appear to set later: so that at times","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the Moon has been seen eclipsed while the Sun appeared still above the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"horizon. And so also the heights of the Sun and of the Moon, and those","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of all the Stars always appear a little greater than they are in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"reality, because of these same refractions, as Astronomers know. But","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,there is one experiment which renders this refraction very evident;,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which is that of fixing a telescope on some spot so that it views an,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"object, such as a steeple or a house, at a distance of half a league","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"or more. If then you look through it at different hours of the day,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"leaving it always fixed in the same way, you will see that the same","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,spots of the object will not always appear at the middle of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"aperture of the telescope, but that generally in the morning and in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the evening, when there are more vapours near the Earth, these objects","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"seem to rise higher, so that the half or more of them will no longer","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,be visible; and so that they seem lower toward mid-day when these,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,vapours are dissipated.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Those who consider refraction to occur only in the surfaces which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"separate transparent bodies of different nature, would find it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,difficult to give a reason for all that I have just related; but,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,according to our Theory the thing is quite easy. It is known that the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"air which surrounds us, besides the particles which are proper to it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and which float in the ethereal matter as has been explained, is full","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,also of particles of water which are raised by the action of heat; and,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,it has been ascertained further by some very definite experiments that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,as one mounts up higher the density of air diminishes in proportion.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Now whether the particles of water and those of air take part, by","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"means of the particles of ethereal matter, in the movement which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"constitutes light, but have a less prompt recoil than these, or","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,whether the encounter and hindrance which these particles of air and,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"water offer to the propagation of movement of the ethereal progress,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"retard the progression, it follows that both kinds of particles flying","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"amidst the ethereal particles, must render the air, from a great","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"height down to the Earth, gradually less easy for the spreading of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,waves of light.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Whence the configuration of the waves ought to become nearly such as,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"this figure represents: namely, if A is a light, or the visible point","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of a steeple, the waves which start from it ought to spread more","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"widely upwards and less widely downwards, but in other directions more","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"or less as they approximate to these two extremes. This being so, it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,necessarily follows that every line intersecting one of these waves at,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"right angles will pass above the point A, always excepting the one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,line which is perpendicular to the horizon.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Let BC be the wave which brings the light to the spectator who is at,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"B, and let BD be the straight line which intersects this wave at right","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,angles. Now because the ray or straight line by which we judge the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,spot where the object appears to us is nothing else than the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perpendicular to the wave that reaches our eye, as will be understood","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"by what was said above, it is manifest that the point A will be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perceived as being in the line BD, and therefore higher than in fact it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,is.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Similarly if the Earth be AB, and the top of the Atmosphere CD, which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,probably is not a well defined spherical surface (since we know that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the air becomes rare in proportion as one ascends, for above there is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"so much less of it to press down upon it), the waves of light from the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"sun coming, for instance, in such a way that so long as they have not","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,reached the Atmosphere CD the straight line AE intersects them,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perpendicularly, they ought, when they enter the Atmosphere, to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,advance more quickly in elevated regions than in regions nearer to the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Earth. So that if CA is the wave which brings the light to the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spectator at A, its region C will be the furthest advanced; and the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"straight line AF, which intersects this wave at right angles, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which determines the apparent place of the Sun, will pass above the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"real Sun, which will be seen along the line AE. And so it may occur","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that when it ought not to be visible in the absence of vapours,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"because the line AE encounters the rotundity of the Earth, it will be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,perceived in the line AF by refraction. But this angle EAF is scarcely,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ever more than half a degree because the attenuation of the vapours,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,alters the waves of light but little. Furthermore these refractions,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"are not altogether constant in all weathers, particularly at small","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,elevations of 2 or 3 degrees; which results from the different,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,quantity of aqueous vapours rising above the Earth.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,And this same thing is the cause why at certain times a distant object,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"will be hidden behind another less distant one, and yet may at another","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"time be able to be seen, although the spot from which it is viewed is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,always the same. But the reason for this effect will be still more,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,evident from what we are going to remark touching the curvature of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,rays. It appears from the things explained above that the progression,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,or propagation of a small part of a wave of light is properly what one,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"calls a ray. Now these rays, instead of being straight as they are in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"homogeneous media, ought to be curved in an atmosphere of unequal","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,penetrability. For they necessarily follow from the object to the eye,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the line which intersects at right angles all the progressions of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"waves, as in the first figure the line AEB does, as will be shown","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,hereafter; and it is this line which determines what interposed bodies,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,would or would not hinder us from seeing the object. For although the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"point of the steeple A appears raised to D, it would yet not appear to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the eye B if the tower H was between the two, because it crosses the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"curve AEB. But the tower E, which is beneath this curve, does not","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,hinder the point A from being seen. Now according as the air near the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Earth exceeds in density that which is higher, the curvature of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ray AEB becomes greater: so that at certain times it passes above the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"summit E, which allows the point A to be perceived by the eye at B;","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and at other times it is intercepted by the same tower E which hides A,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,from this same eye.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,But to demonstrate this curvature of the rays conformably to all our,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"preceding Theory, let us imagine that AB is a small portion of a wave","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of light coming from the side C, which we may consider as a straight","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"line. Let us also suppose that it is perpendicular to the Horizon, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,portion B being nearer to the Earth than the portion A; and that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"because the vapours are less hindering at A than at B, the particular","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,wave which comes from the point A spreads through a certain space AD,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,while the particular wave which starts from the point B spreads,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,through a shorter space BE; AD and BE being parallel to the Horizon.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Further, supposing the straight lines FG, HI, etc., to be drawn from","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,an infinitude of points in the straight line AB and to terminate on,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the line DE (which is straight or may be considered as such), let the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,different penetrabilities at the different heights in the air between,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,A and B be represented by all these lines; so that the particular,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"wave, originating from the point F, will spread across the space FG,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and that from the point H across the space HI, while that from the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,point A spreads across the space AD.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Now if about the centres A, B, one describes the circles DK, EL, which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,represent the spreading of the waves which originate from these two,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"points, and if one draws the straight line KL which touches these two","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"circles, it is easy to see that this same line will be the common","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"tangent to all the other circles drawn about the centres F, H, etc.;","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and that all the points of contact will fall within that part of this,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"line which is comprised between the perpendiculars AK, BL. Then it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,will be the line KL which will terminate the movement of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,particular waves originating from the points of the wave AB; and this,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"movement will be stronger between the points KL, than anywhere else at","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the same instant, since an infinitude of circumferences concur to form","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,this straight line; and consequently KL will be the propagation of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"portion of wave AB, as has been said in explaining reflexion and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ordinary refraction. Now it appears that AK and BL dip down toward the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,side where the air is less easy to penetrate: for AK being longer than,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"BL, and parallel to it, it follows that the lines AB and KL, being","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"prolonged, would meet at the side L. But the angle K is a right angle:","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"hence KAB is necessarily acute, and consequently less than DAB. If one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,investigates in the same way the progression of the portion of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"wave KL, one will find that after a further time it has arrived at MN","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"in such a manner that the perpendiculars KM, LN, dip down even more","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"than do AK, BL. And this suffices to show that the ray will continue","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"along the curved line which intersects all the waves at right angles,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,as has been said.,"Huygens, Christiaan"

14725,ON THE STRANGE REFRACTION OF ICELAND CRYSTAL,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,1.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"There is brought from Iceland, which is an Island in the North Sea, in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the latitude of 66 degrees, a kind of Crystal or transparent stone,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"very remarkable for its figure and other qualities, but above all for","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,its strange refractions. The causes of this have seemed to me to be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"worthy of being carefully investigated, the more so because amongst","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,transparent bodies this one alone does not follow the ordinary rules,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,with respect to rays of light. I have even been under some necessity,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to make this research, because the refractions of this Crystal seemed","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,to overturn our preceding explanation of regular refraction; which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"explanation, on the contrary, they strongly confirm, as will be seen","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,after they have been brought under the same principle. In Iceland are,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"found great lumps of this Crystal, some of which I have seen of 4 or 5","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"pounds. But it occurs also in other countries, for I have had some of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the same sort which had been found in France near the town of Troyes,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"in Champagne, and some others which came from the Island of Corsica,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"though both were less clear and only in little bits, scarcely capable","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of letting any effect of refraction be observed.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,2. The first knowledge which the public has had about it is due to Mr.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Erasmus Bartholinus, who has given a description of Iceland Crystal","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and of its chief phenomena. But here I shall not desist from giving my,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"own, both for the instruction of those who may not have seen his book,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and because as respects some of these phenomena there is a slight,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,difference between his observations and those which I have made: for I,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,have applied myself with great exactitude to examine these properties,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of refraction, in order to be quite sure before undertaking to explain","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the causes of them.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"3. As regards the hardness of this stone, and the property which it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"has of being easily split, it must be considered rather as a species","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of Talc than of Crystal. For an iron spike effects an entrance into it,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"as easily as into any other Talc or Alabaster, to which it is equal in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,gravity.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,4. The pieces of it which are found have the figure of an oblique,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,parallelepiped; each of the six faces being a parallelogram; and it,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,admits of being split in three directions parallel to two of these,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"opposed faces. Even in such wise, if you will, that all the six faces","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,are equal and similar rhombuses. The figure here added represents a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"piece of this Crystal. The obtuse angles of all the parallelograms, as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"C, D, here, are angles of 101 degrees 52 minutes, and consequently","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the acute angles, such as A and B, are of 78 degrees 8 minutes.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"5. Of the solid angles there are two opposite to one another, such as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"C and E, which are each composed of three equal obtuse plane angles.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,The other six are composed of two acute angles and one obtuse. All,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that I have just said has been likewise remarked by Mr. Bartholinus in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the aforesaid treatise; if we differ it is only slightly about the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,values of the angles. He recounts moreover some other properties of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"this Crystal; to wit, that when rubbed against cloth it attracts","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"straws and other light things as do amber, diamond, glass, and Spanish","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"wax. Let a piece be covered with water for a day or more, the surface","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,loses its natural polish. When aquafortis is poured on it it produces,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ebullition, especially, as I have found, if the Crystal has been","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,pulverized. I have also found by experiment that it may be heated to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,redness in the fire without being in anywise altered or rendered less,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,transparent; but a very violent fire calcines it nevertheless. Its,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"transparency is scarcely less than that of water or of Rock Crystal,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and devoid of colour. But rays of light pass through it in another,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,fashion and produce those marvellous refractions the causes of which I,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,am now going to try to explain; reserving for the end of this Treatise,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the statement of my conjectures touching the formation and,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,extraordinary configuration of this Crystal.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,6. In all other transparent bodies that we know there is but one sole,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and simple refraction; but in this substance there are two different,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ones. The effect is that objects seen through it, especially such as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"are placed right against it, appear double; and that a ray of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"sunlight, falling on one of its surfaces, parts itself into two rays","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and traverses the Crystal thus.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,7. It is again a general law in all other transparent bodies that the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ray which falls perpendicularly on their surface passes straight on,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"without suffering refraction, and that an oblique ray is always","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,refracted. But in this Crystal the perpendicular ray suffers,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refraction, and there are oblique rays which pass through it quite","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,straight.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"8. But in order to explain these phenomena more particularly, let","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"there be, in the first place, a piece ABFE of the same Crystal, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"let the obtuse angle ACB, one of the three which constitute the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"equilateral solid angle C, be divided into two equal parts by the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"straight line CG, and let it be conceived that the Crystal is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,intersected by a plane which passes through this line and through the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"side CF, which plane will necessarily be perpendicular to the surface","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,AB; and its section in the Crystal will form a parallelogram GCFH. We,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,will call this section the principal section of the Crystal.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"9. Now if one covers the surface AB, leaving there only a small","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"aperture at the point K, situated in the straight line CG, and if one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"exposes it to the sun, so that his rays face it perpendicularly above,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"then the ray IK will divide itself at the point K into two, one of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which will continue to go on straight by KL, and the other will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"separate itself along the straight line KM, which is in the plane","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"GCFH, and which makes with KL an angle of about 6 degrees 40 minutes,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,tending from the side of the solid angle C; and on emerging from the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"other side of the Crystal it will turn again parallel to JK, along MZ.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"And as, in this extraordinary refraction, the point M is seen by the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refracted ray MKI, which I consider as going to the eye at I, it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"necessarily follows that the point L, by virtue of the same","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refraction, will be seen by the refracted ray LRI, so that LR will be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,parallel to MK if the distance from the eye KI is supposed very great.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,The point L appears then as being in the straight line IRS; but the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"same point appears also, by ordinary refraction, to be in the straight","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"line IK, hence it is necessarily judged to be double. And similarly if","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,L be a small hole in a sheet of paper or other substance which is laid,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"against the Crystal, it will appear when turned towards daylight as if","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"there were two holes, which will seem the wider apart from one another","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the greater the thickness of the Crystal.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"10. Again, if one turns the Crystal in such wise that an incident ray","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"NO, of sunlight, which I suppose to be in the plane continued from","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"GCFH, makes with GC an angle of 73 degrees and 20 minutes, and is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"consequently nearly parallel to the edge CF, which makes with FH an","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"angle of 70 degrees 57 minutes, according to the calculation which I","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"shall put at the end, it will divide itself at the point O into two","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"rays, one of which will continue along OP in a straight line with NO,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and will similarly pass out of the other side of the crystal without,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,any refraction; but the other will be refracted and will go along OQ.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,And it must be noted that it is special to the plane through GCF and,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to those which are parallel to it, that all incident rays which are in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,one of these planes continue to be in it after they have entered the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Crystal and have become double; for it is quite otherwise for rays in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"all other planes which intersect the Crystal, as we shall see","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,afterwards.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,11. I recognized at first by these experiments and by some others that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of the two refractions which the ray suffers in this Crystal, there is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,one which follows the ordinary rules; and it is this to which the rays,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,KL and OQ belong. This is why I have distinguished this ordinary,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,refraction from the other; and having measured it by exact,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"observation, I found that its proportion, considered as to the Sines","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of the angles which the incident and refracted rays make with the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perpendicular, was very precisely that of 5 to 3, as was found also by","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Mr. Bartholinus, and consequently much greater than that of Rock","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Crystal, or of glass, which is nearly 3 to 2.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,12. The mode of making these observations exactly is as follows. Upon,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,a leaf of paper fixed on a thoroughly flat table there is traced a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"black line AB, and two others, CED and KML, which cut it at right","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,angles and are more or less distant from one another according as it,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,is desired to examine a ray that is more or less oblique. Then place,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the Crystal upon the intersection E so that the line AB concurs with,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that which bisects the obtuse angle of the lower surface, or with some","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,line parallel to it. Then by placing the eye directly above the line,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,AB it will appear single only; and one will see that the portion,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"viewed through the Crystal and the portions which appear outside it,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"meet together in a straight line: but the line CD will appear double,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and one can distinguish the image which is due to regular refraction,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,by the circumstance that when one views it with both eyes it seems,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"raised up more than the other, or again by the circumstance that, when","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the Crystal is turned around on the paper, this image remains","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"stationary, whereas the other image shifts and moves entirely around.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Afterwards let the eye be placed at I (remaining always in the plane,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,perpendicular through AB) so that it views the image which is formed,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,by regular refraction of the line CD making a straight line with the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"remainder of that line which is outside the Crystal. And then, marking","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,on the surface of the Crystal the point H where the intersection E,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"appears, this point will be directly above E. Then draw back the eye","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"towards O, keeping always in the plane perpendicular through AB, so","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that the image of the line CD, which is formed by ordinary refraction,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,may appear in a straight line with the line KL viewed without,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,refraction; and then mark on the Crystal the point N where the point,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of intersection E appears.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"13. Then one will know the length and position of the lines NH, EM,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and of HE, which is the thickness of the Crystal: which lines being","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"traced separately upon a plan, and then joining NE and NM which cuts","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"HE at P, the proportion of the refraction will be that of EN to NP,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"because these lines are to one another as the sines of the angles NPH,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"NEP, which are equal to those which the incident ray ON and its","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,refraction NE make with the perpendicular to the surface. This,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"proportion, as I have said, is sufficiently precisely as 5 to 3, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,is always the same for all inclinations of the incident ray.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,14. The same mode of observation has also served me for examining the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"extraordinary or irregular refraction of this Crystal. For, the point","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"H having been found and marked, as aforesaid, directly above the point","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"E, I observed the appearance of the line CD, which is made by the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"extraordinary refraction; and having placed the eye at Q, so that this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,appearance made a straight line with the line KL viewed without,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refraction, I ascertained the triangles REH, RES, and consequently the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"angles RSH, RES, which the incident and the refracted ray make with","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the perpendicular.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,15. But I found in this refraction that the ratio of FR to RS was not,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"constant, like the ordinary refraction, but that it varied with the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,varying obliquity of the incident ray.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"16. I found also that when QRE made a straight line, that is, when the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,incident ray entered the Crystal without being refracted (as I,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ascertained by the circumstance that then the point E viewed by the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"extraordinary refraction appeared in the line CD, as seen without","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refraction) I found, I say, then that the angle QRG was 73 degrees 20","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"minutes, as has been already remarked; and so it is not the ray","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"parallel to the edge of the Crystal, which crosses it in a straight","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"line without being refracted, as Mr. Bartholinus believed, since that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"inclination is only 70 degrees 57 minutes, as was stated above. And","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"this is to be noted, in order that no one may search in vain for the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,cause of the singular property of this ray in its parallelism to the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,edges mentioned.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"17. Finally, continuing my observations to discover the nature of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"this refraction, I learned that it obeyed the following remarkable","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"rule. Let the parallelogram GCFH, made by the principal section of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Crystal, as previously determined, be traced separately. I found then","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that always, when the inclinations of two rays which come from","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"opposite sides, as VK, SK here, are equal, their refractions KX and KT","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,meet the bottom line HF in such wise that points X and T are equally,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"distant from the point M, where the refraction of the perpendicular","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ray IK falls; and this occurs also for refractions in other sections,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of this Crystal. But before speaking of those, which have also other","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"particular properties, we will investigate the causes of the phenomena","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which I have already reported.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,It was after having explained the refraction of ordinary transparent,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"bodies by means of the spherical emanations of light, as above, that I","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"resumed my examination of the nature of this Crystal, wherein I had","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,previously been unable to discover anything.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"18. As there were two different refractions, I conceived that there","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"were also two different emanations of waves of light, and that one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,could occur in the ethereal matter extending through the body of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Crystal. Which matter, being present in much larger quantity than is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that of the particles which compose it, was alone capable of causing","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"transparency, according to what has been explained heretofore. I","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,attributed to this emanation of waves the regular refraction which is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"observed in this stone, by supposing these waves to be ordinarily of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spherical form, and having a slower progression within the Crystal","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,than they have outside it; whence proceeds refraction as I have,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,demonstrated.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,19. As to the other emanation which should produce the irregular,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refraction, I wished to try what Elliptical waves, or rather","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spheroidal waves, would do; and these I supposed would spread","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,indifferently both in the ethereal matter diffused throughout the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"crystal and in the particles of which it is composed, according to the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,last mode in which I have explained transparency. It seemed to me that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the disposition or regular arrangement of these particles could,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,contribute to form spheroidal waves (nothing more being required for,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,this than that the successive movement of light should spread a little,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,more quickly in one direction than in the other) and I scarcely,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,doubted that there were in this crystal such an arrangement of equal,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and similar particles, because of its figure and of its angles with","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"their determinate and invariable measure. Touching which particles,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and their form and disposition, I shall, at the end of this Treatise,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,propound my conjectures and some experiments which confirm them.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"20. The double emission of waves of light, which I had imagined,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,became more probable to me after I had observed a certain phenomenon,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"in the ordinary [Rock] Crystal, which occurs in hexagonal form, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which, because of this regularity, seems also to be composed of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"particles, of definite figure, and ranged in order. This was, that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"this crystal, as well as that from Iceland, has a double refraction,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,though less evident. For having had cut from it some well polished,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Prisms of different sections, I remarked in all, in viewing through","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"them the flame of a candle or the lead of window panes, that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"everything appeared double, though with images not very distant from","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"one another. Whence I understood the reason why this substance, though","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"so transparent, is useless for Telescopes, when they have ever so","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,little length.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"21. Now this double refraction, according to my Theory hereinbefore","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"established, seemed to demand a double emission of waves of light,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,both of them spherical (for both the refractions are regular) and,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,those of one series a little slower only than the others. For thus the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"phenomenon is quite naturally explained, by postulating substances","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which serve as vehicle for these waves, as I have done in the case of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Iceland Crystal. I had then less trouble after that in admitting two,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,emissions of waves in one and the same body. And since it might have,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,been objected that in composing these two kinds of crystal of equal,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"particles of a certain figure, regularly piled, the interstices which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,these particles leave and which contain the ethereal matter would,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,scarcely suffice to transmit the waves of light which I have localized,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"there, I removed this difficulty by regarding these particles as being","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of a very rare texture, or rather as composed of other much smaller","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"particles, between which the ethereal matter passes quite freely.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"This, moreover, necessarily follows from that which has been already","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,demonstrated touching the small quantity of matter of which the bodies,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,are built up.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"22. Supposing then these spheroidal waves besides the spherical ones,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,I began to examine whether they could serve to explain the phenomena,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of the irregular refraction, and how by these same phenomena I could","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,determine the figure and position of the spheroids: as to which I,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"obtained at last the desired success, by proceeding as follows.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"23. I considered first the effect of waves so formed, as respects the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ray which falls perpendicularly on the flat surface of a transparent,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,body in which they should spread in this manner. I took AB for the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"exposed region of the surface. And, since a ray perpendicular to a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"plane, and coming from a very distant source of light, is nothing","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"else, according to the precedent Theory, than the incidence of a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"portion of the wave parallel to that plane, I supposed the straight","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"line RC, parallel and equal to AB, to be a portion of a wave of light,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,in which an infinitude of points such as RH_h_C come to meet the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,surface AB at the points AK_k_B. Then instead of the hemispherical,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,partial waves which in a body of ordinary refraction would spread from,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"each of these last points, as we have above explained in treating of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refraction, these must here be hemi-spheroids. The axes (or rather the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"major diameters) of these I supposed to be oblique to the plane AB, as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"is AV the semi-axis or semi-major diameter of the spheroid SVT, which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"represents the partial wave coming from the point A, after the wave RC","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"has reached AB. I say axis or major diameter, because the same ellipse","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,SVT may be considered as the section of a spheroid of which the axis,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"is AZ perpendicular to AV. But, for the present, without yet deciding","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"one or other, we will consider these spheroids only in those sections","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of them which make ellipses in the plane of this figure. Now taking a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"certain space of time during which the wave SVT has spread from A, it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,would needs be that from all the other points K_k_B there should,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"proceed, in the same time, waves similar to SVT and similarly","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,situated. And the common tangent NQ of all these semi-ellipses would,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"be the propagation of the wave RC which fell on AB, and would be the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,place where this movement occurs in much greater amount than anywhere,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"else, being made up of arcs of an infinity of ellipses, the centres of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which are along the line AB.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"24. Now it appeared that this common tangent NQ was parallel to AB,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and of the same length, but that it was not directly opposite to it,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"since it was comprised between the lines AN, BQ, which are diameters","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of ellipses having A and B for centres, conjugate with respect to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,diameters which are not in the straight line AB. And in this way I,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"comprehended, a matter which had seemed to me very difficult, how a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ray perpendicular to a surface could suffer refraction on entering a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"transparent body; seeing that the wave RC, having come to the aperture","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"AB, went on forward thence, spreading between the parallel lines AN,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"BQ, yet itself remaining always parallel to AB, so that here the light","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"does not spread along lines perpendicular to its waves, as in ordinary","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refraction, but along lines cutting the waves obliquely.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,25. Inquiring subsequently what might be the position and form of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"these spheroids in the crystal, I considered that all the six faces","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"produced precisely the same refractions. Taking, then, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"parallelopiped AFB, of which the obtuse solid angle C is contained","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"between the three equal plane angles, and imagining in it the three","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"principal sections, one of which is perpendicular to the face DC and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"passes through the edge CF, another perpendicular to the face BF","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"passing through the edge CA, and the third perpendicular to the face","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,AF passing through the edge BC; I knew that the refractions of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,incident rays belonging to these three planes were all similar. But,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,there could be no position of the spheroid which would have the same,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,relation to these three sections except that in which the axis was,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,also the axis of the solid angle C. Consequently I saw that the axis,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of this angle, that is to say the straight line which traversed the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"crystal from the point C with equal inclination to the edges CF, CA,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,CB was the line which determined the position of the axis of all the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spheroidal waves which one imagined to originate from some point,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"taken within or on the surface of the crystal, since all these","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spheroids ought to be alike, and have their axes parallel to one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,another.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"26. Considering after this the plane of one of these three sections,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"namely that through GCF, the angle of which is 109 degrees 3 minutes,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"since the angle F was shown above to be 70 degrees 57 minutes; and,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"imagining a spheroidal wave about the centre C, I knew, because I have","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"just explained it, that its axis must be in the same plane, the half","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of which axis I have marked CS in the next figure: and seeking by,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,calculation (which will be given with others at the end of this,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"discourse) the value of the angle CGS, I found it 45 degrees 20","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,minutes.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"27. To know from this the form of this spheroid, that is to say the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"proportion of the semi-diameters CS, CP, of its elliptical section,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which are perpendicular to one another, I considered that the point M","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"where the ellipse is touched by the straight line FH, parallel to CG,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ought to be so situated that CM makes with the perpendicular CL an,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"angle of 6 degrees 40 minutes; since, this being so, this ellipse","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,satisfies what has been said about the refraction of the ray,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perpendicular to the surface CG, which is inclined to the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perpendicular CL by the same angle. This, then, being thus disposed,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and taking CM at 100,000 parts, I found by the calculation which will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"be given at the end, the semi-major diameter CP to be 105,032, and the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"semi-axis CS to be 93,410, the ratio of which numbers is very nearly 9","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,to 8; so that the spheroid was of the kind which resembles a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"compressed sphere, being generated by the revolution of an ellipse","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,about its smaller diameter. I found also the value of CG the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"semi-diameter parallel to the tangent ML to be 98,779.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,28. Now passing to the investigation of the refractions which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"obliquely incident rays must undergo, according to our hypothesis of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spheroidal waves, I saw that these refractions depended on the ratio","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,between the velocity of movement of the light outside the crystal in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the ether, and that within the crystal. For supposing, for example,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,this proportion to be such that while the light in the crystal forms,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the spheroid GSP, as I have just said, it forms outside a sphere the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,semi-diameter of which is equal to the line N which will be determined,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"hereafter, the following is the way of finding the refraction of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,incident rays. Let there be such a ray RC falling upon the surface,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"CK. Make CO perpendicular to RC, and across the angle KCO adjust OK,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"equal to N and perpendicular to CO; then draw KI, which touches the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Ellipse GSP, and from the point of contact I join IC, which will be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the required refraction of the ray RC. The demonstration of this is,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"it will be seen, entirely similar to that of which we made use in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,explaining ordinary refraction. For the refraction of the ray RC is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"nothing else than the progression of the portion C of the wave CO,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"continued in the crystal. Now the portions H of this wave, during the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"time that O came to K, will have arrived at the surface CK along the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"straight lines H_x_, and will moreover have produced in the crystal","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,around the centres _x_ some hemi-spheroidal partial waves similar to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the hemi-spheroidal GSP_g_, and similarly disposed, and of which the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,major and minor diameters will bear the same proportions to the lines,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,_xv_ (the continuations of the lines H_x_ up to KB parallel to CO),"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that the diameters of the spheroid GSP_g_ bear to the line CB, or N.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,And it is quite easy to see that the common tangent of all these,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spheroids, which are here represented by Ellipses, will be the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"straight line IK, which consequently will be the propagation of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"wave CO; and the point I will be that of the point C, conformably with","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that which has been demonstrated in ordinary refraction.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Now as to finding the point of contact I, it is known that one must","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"find CD a third proportional to the lines CK, CG, and draw DI parallel","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to CM, previously determined, which is the conjugate diameter to CG;","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"for then, by drawing KI it touches the Ellipse at I.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"29. Now as we have found CI the refraction of the ray RC, similarly","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"one will find C_i_ the refraction of the ray _r_C, which comes from","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the opposite side, by making C_o_ perpendicular to _r_C and following","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,out the rest of the construction as before. Whence one sees that if,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the ray _r_C is inclined equally with RC, the line C_d_ will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"necessarily be equal to CD, because C_k_ is equal to CK, and C_g_ to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,CG. And in consequence I_i_ will be cut at E into equal parts by the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"line CM, to which DI and _di_ are parallel. And because CM is the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"conjugate diameter to CG, it follows that _i_I will be parallel to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"_g_G. Therefore if one prolongs the refracted rays CI, C_i_, until","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"they meet the tangent ML at T and _t_, the distances MT, M_t_, will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"also be equal. And so, by our hypothesis, we explain perfectly the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"phenomenon mentioned above; to wit, that when there are two rays","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"equally inclined, but coming from opposite sides, as here the rays RC,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"_rc_, their refractions diverge equally from the line followed by the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refraction of the ray perpendicular to the surface, by considering","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,these divergences in the direction parallel to the surface of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,crystal.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"30. To find the length of the line N, in proportion to CP, CS, CG, it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,must be determined by observations of the irregular refraction which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,occurs in this section of the crystal; and I find thus that the ratio,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of N to GC is just a little less than 8 to 5. And having regard to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,some other observations and phenomena of which I shall speak,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"afterwards, I put N at 156,962 parts, of which the semi-diameter CG is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"found to contain 98,779, making this ratio 8 to 5-1/29. Now this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"proportion, which there is between the line N and CG, may be called","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the Proportion of the Refraction; similarly as in glass that of 3 to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"2, as will be manifest when I shall have explained a short process in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the preceding way to find the irregular refractions.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"31. Supposing then, in the next figure, as previously, the surface of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the crystal _g_G, the Ellipse GP_g_, and the line N; and CM the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refraction of the perpendicular ray FC, from which it diverges by 6","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"degrees 40 minutes. Now let there be some other ray RC, the refraction","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of which must be found.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"About the centre C, with semi-diameter CG, let the circumference _g_RG","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"be described, cutting the ray RC at R; and let RV be the perpendicular","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"on CG. Then as the line N is to CG let CV be to CD, and let DI be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"drawn parallel to CM, cutting the Ellipse _g_MG at I; then joining CI,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,this will be the required refraction of the ray RC. Which is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,demonstrated thus.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Let CO be perpendicular to CR, and across the angle OCG let OK be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"adjusted, equal to N and perpendicular to CO, and let there be drawn","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the straight line KI, which if it is demonstrated to be a tangent to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the Ellipse at I, it will be evident by the things heretofore","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,explained that CI is the refraction of the ray RC. Now since the angle,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"RCO is a right angle, it is easy to see that the right-angled","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"triangles RCV, KCO, are similar. As then, CK is to KO, so also is RC","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to CV. But KO is equal to N, and RC to CG: then as CK is to N so will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"CG be to CV. But as N is to CG, so, by construction, is CV to CD. Then","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"as CK is to CG so is CG to CD. And because DI is parallel to CM, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"conjugate diameter to CG, it follows that KI touches the Ellipse at I;","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which remained to be shown.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,32. One sees then that as there is in the refraction of ordinary,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,media a certain constant proportion between the sines of the angles,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which the incident ray and the refracted ray make with the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perpendicular, so here there is such a proportion between CV and CD or","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,IE; that is to say between the Sine of the angle which the incident,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ray makes with the perpendicular, and the horizontal intercept, in the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Ellipse, between the refraction of this ray and the diameter CM. For","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the ratio of CV to CD is, as has been said, the same as that of N to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the semi-diameter CG.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"33. I will add here, before passing away, that in comparing together","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the regular and irregular refraction of this crystal, there is this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"remarkable fact, that if ABPS be the spheroid by which light spreads","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"in the Crystal in a certain space of time (which spreading, as has","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"been said, serves for the irregular refraction), then the inscribed","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,sphere BVST is the extension in the same space of time of the light,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which serves for the regular refraction.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"For we have stated before this, that the line N being the radius of a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spherical wave of light in air, while in the crystal it spread through","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the spheroid ABPS, the ratio of N to CS will be 156,962 to 93,410. But","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,it has also been stated that the proportion of the regular refraction,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"was 5 to 3; that is to say, that N being the radius of a spherical","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"wave of light in air, its extension in the crystal would, in the same","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"space of time, form a sphere the radius of which would be to N as 3 to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"5. Now 156,962 is to 93,410 as 5 to 3 less 1/41. So that it is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"sufficiently nearly, and may be exactly, the sphere BVST, which the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"light describes for the regular refraction in the crystal, while it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"describes the spheroid BPSA for the irregular refraction, and while it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,describes the sphere of radius N in air outside the crystal.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Although then there are, according to what we have supposed, two","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"different propagations of light within the crystal, it appears that it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,is only in directions perpendicular to the axis BS of the spheroid,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that one of these propagations occurs more rapidly than the other; but,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that they have an equal velocity in the other direction, namely, in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that parallel to the same axis BS, which is also the axis of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,obtuse angle of the crystal.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"34. The proportion of the refraction being what we have just seen, I","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,will now show that there necessarily follows thence that notable,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,property of the ray which falling obliquely on the surface of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,crystal enters it without suffering refraction. For supposing the same,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"things as before, and that the ray makes with the same surface _g_G","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the angle RCG of 73 degrees 20 minutes, inclining to the same side as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the crystal (of which ray mention has been made above); if one,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"investigates, by the process above explained, the refraction CI, one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"will find that it makes exactly a straight line with RC, and that thus","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"this ray is not deviated at all, conformably with experiment. This is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,proved as follows by calculation.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"CG or CR being, as precedently, 98,779; CM being 100,000; and the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"angle RCV 73 degrees 20 minutes, CV will be 28,330. But because CI is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the refraction of the ray RC, the proportion of CV to CD is 156,962 to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"98,779, namely, that of N to CG; then CD is 17,828.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Now the rectangle _g_DC is to the square of DI as the square of CG is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to the square of CM; hence DI or CE will be 98,353. But as CE is to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"EI, so will CM be to MT, which will then be 18,127. And being added to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ML, which is 11,609 (namely the sine of the angle LCM, which is 6","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"degrees 40 minutes, taking CM 100,000 as radius) we get LT 27,936; and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"this is to LC 99,324 as CV to VR, that is to say, as 29,938, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"tangent of the complement of the angle RCV, which is 73 degrees 20","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"minutes, is to the radius of the Tables. Whence it appears that RCIT","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,is a straight line; which was to be proved.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,35. Further it will be seen that the ray CI in emerging through the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"opposite surface of the crystal, ought to pass out quite straight,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"according to the following demonstration, which proves that the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,reciprocal relation of refraction obtains in this crystal the same as,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"in other transparent bodies; that is to say, that if a ray RC in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"meeting the surface of the crystal CG is refracted as CI, the ray CI","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"emerging through the opposite parallel surface of the crystal, which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"I suppose to be IB, will have its refraction IA parallel to the ray","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,RC.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Let the same things be supposed as before; that is to say, let CO,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perpendicular to CR, represent a portion of a wave the continuation of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which in the crystal is IK, so that the piece C will be continued on","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"along the straight line CI, while O comes to K. Now if one takes a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"second period of time equal to the first, the piece K of the wave IK","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"will, in this second period, have advanced along the straight line KB,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"equal and parallel to CI, because every piece of the wave CO, on","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"arriving at the surface CK, ought to go on in the crystal the same as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the piece C; and in this same time there will be formed in the air,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,from the point I a partial spherical wave having a semi-diameter IA,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"equal to KO, since KO has been traversed in an equal time. Similarly,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"if one considers some other point of the wave IK, such as _h_, it will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"go along _hm_, parallel to CI, to meet the surface IB, while the point","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,K traverses K_l_ equal to _hm_; and while this accomplishes the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"remainder _l_B, there will start from the point _m_ a partial wave the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"semi-diameter of which, _mn_, will have the same ratio to _l_B as IA","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to KB. Whence it is evident that this wave of semi-diameter _mn_, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the other of semi-diameter IA will have the same tangent BA. And,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,similarly for all the partial spherical waves which will be formed,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,outside the crystal by the impact of all the points of the wave IK,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,against the surface of the Ether IB. It is then precisely the tangent,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"BA which will be the continuation of the wave IK, outside the crystal,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"when the piece K has reached B. And in consequence IA, which is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perpendicular to BA, will be the refraction of the ray CI on emerging","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,from the crystal. Now it is clear that IA is parallel to the incident,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ray RC, since IB is equal to CK, and IA equal to KO, and the angles A","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and O are right angles.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"It is seen then that, according to our hypothesis, the reciprocal","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,relation of refraction holds good in this crystal as well as in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ordinary transparent bodies; as is thus in fact found by observation.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"36. I pass now to the consideration of other sections of the crystal,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and of the refractions there produced, on which, as will be seen, some","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,other very remarkable phenomena depend.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Let ABH be a parallelepiped of crystal, and let the top surface AEHF","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"be a perfect rhombus, the obtuse angles of which are equally divided","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"by the straight line EF, and the acute angles by the straight line AH","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,perpendicular to FE.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,The section which we have hitherto considered is that which passes,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"through the lines EF, EB, and which at the same time cuts the plane","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,AEHF at right angles. Refractions in this section have this in common,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,with the refractions in ordinary media that the plane which is drawn,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,through the incident ray and which also intersects the surface of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"crystal at right angles, is that in which the refracted ray also is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,found. But the refractions which appertain to every other section of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,this crystal have this strange property that the refracted ray always,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"quits the plane of the incident ray perpendicular to the surface, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,turns away towards the side of the slope of the crystal. For which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"fact we shall show the reason, in the first place, for the section","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,through AH; and we shall show at the same time how one can determine,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the refraction, according to our hypothesis. Let there be, then, in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the plane which passes through AH, and which is perpendicular to the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"plane AFHE, the incident ray RC; it is required to find its refraction","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,in the crystal.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"37. About the centre C, which I suppose to be in the intersection of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"AH and FE, let there be imagined a hemi-spheroid QG_qg_M, such as the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"light would form in spreading in the crystal, and let its section by","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the plane AEHF form the Ellipse QG_qg_, the major diameter of which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Q_q_, which is in the line AH, will necessarily be one of the major","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,diameters of the spheroid; because the axis of the spheroid being in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the plane through FEB, to which QC is perpendicular, it follows that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"QC is also perpendicular to the axis of the spheroid, and consequently","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,QC_q_ one of its major diameters. But the minor diameter of this,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Ellipse, G_g_, will bear to Q_q_ the proportion which has been defined","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"previously, Article 27, between CG and the major semi-diameter of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spheroid, CP, namely, that of 98,779 to 105,032.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Let the line N be the length of the travel of light in air during the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"time in which, within the crystal, it makes, from the centre C, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,spheroid QC_qg_M. Then having drawn CO perpendicular to the ray CR and,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"situate in the plane through CR and AH, let there be adjusted, across","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the angle ACO, the straight line OK equal to N and perpendicular to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"CO, and let it meet the straight line AH at K. Supposing consequently","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that CL is perpendicular to the surface of the crystal AEHF, and that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,CM is the refraction of the ray which falls perpendicularly on this,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"same surface, let there be drawn a plane through the line CM and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"through KCH, making in the spheroid the semi-ellipse QM_q_, which will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"be given, since the angle MCL is given of value 6 degrees 40 minutes.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"And it is certain, according to what has been explained above, Article","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"27, that a plane which would touch the spheroid at the point M, where","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"I suppose the straight line CM to meet the surface, would be parallel","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,to the plane QG_q_. If then through the point K one now draws KS,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"parallel to G_g_, which will be parallel also to QX, the tangent to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the Ellipse QG_q_ at Q; and if one conceives a plane passing through,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"KS and touching the spheroid, the point of contact will necessarily be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"in the Ellipse QM_q_, because this plane through KS, as well as the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"plane which touches the spheroid at the point M, are parallel to QX,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the tangent of the spheroid: for this consequence will be demonstrated,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"at the end of this Treatise. Let this point of contact be at I, then","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"making KC, QC, DC proportionals, draw DI parallel to CM; also join CI.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,I say that CI will be the required refraction of the ray RC. This will,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"be manifest if, in considering CO, which is perpendicular to the ray","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"RC, as a portion of the wave of light, we can demonstrate that the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"continuation of its piece C will be found in the crystal at I, when O","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,has arrived at K.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"38. Now as in the Chapter on Reflexion, in demonstrating that the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,incident and reflected rays are always in the same plane perpendicular,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to the reflecting surface, we considered the breadth of the wave of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"light, so, similarly, we must here consider the breadth of the wave CO","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,in the diameter G_g_. Taking then the breadth C_c_ on the side toward,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the angle E, let the parallelogram CO_oc_ be taken as a portion of a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"wave, and let us complete the parallelograms CK_kc_, CI_ic_, Kl_ik_,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,OK_ko_. In the time then that the line O_o_ arrives at the surface of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the crystal at K_k_, all the points of the wave CO_oc_ will have","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,arrived at the rectangle K_c_ along lines parallel to OK; and from the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"points of their incidences there will originate, beyond that, in the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"crystal partial hemi-spheroids, similar to the hemi-spheroid QM_q_,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and similarly disposed. These hemi-spheroids will necessarily all,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,touch the plane of the parallelogram KI_ik_ at the same instant that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"O_o_ has reached K_k_. Which is easy to comprehend, since, of these","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"hemi-spheroids, all those which have their centres along the line CK,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,touch this plane in the line KI (for this is to be shown in the same,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,way as we have demonstrated the refraction of the oblique ray in the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,principal section through EF) and all those which have their centres,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,in the line C_c_ will touch the same plane KI in the line I_i_; all,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,these being similar to the hemi-spheroid QM_q_. Since then the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"parallelogram K_i_ is that which touches all these spheroids, this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,same parallelogram will be precisely the continuation of the wave,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"CO_oc_ in the crystal, when O_o_ has arrived at K_k_, because it forms","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the termination of the movement and because of the quantity of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,movement which occurs more there than anywhere else: and thus it,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,appears that the piece C of the wave CO_oc_ has its continuation at I;,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that is to say, that the ray RC is refracted as CI.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,From this it is to be noted that the proportion of the refraction for,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,this section of the crystal is that of the line N to the semi-diameter,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,CQ; by which one will easily find the refractions of all incident,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"rays, in the same way as we have shown previously for the case of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,section through FE; and the demonstration will be the same. But it,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,appears that the said proportion of the refraction is less here than,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,in the section through FEB; for it was there the same as the ratio of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"N to CG, that is to say, as 156,962 to 98,779, very nearly as 8 to 5;","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and here it is the ratio of N to CQ the major semi-diameter of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spheroid, that is to say, as 156,962 to 105,032, very nearly as 3 to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"2, but just a little less. Which still agrees perfectly with what one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,finds by observation.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"39. For the rest, this diversity of proportion of refraction produces","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,a very singular effect in this Crystal; which is that when it is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,placed upon a sheet of paper on which there are letters or anything,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"else marked, if one views it from above with the two eyes situated in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the plane of the section through EF, one sees the letters raised up by","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,this irregular refraction more than when one puts one's eyes in the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,plane of section through AH: and the difference of these elevations,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,appears by comparison with the other ordinary refraction of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"crystal, the proportion of which is as 5 to 3, and which always raises","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the letters equally, and higher than the irregular refraction does.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"For one sees the letters and the paper on which they are written, as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,on two different stages at the same time; and in the first position of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the eyes, namely, when they are in the plane through AH these two","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,stages are four times more distant from one another than when the eyes,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,are in the plane through EF.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,We will show that this effect follows from the refractions; and it,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,will enable us at the same time to ascertain the apparent place of a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"point of an object placed immediately under the crystal, according to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the different situation of the eyes.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,40. Let us see first by how much the irregular refraction of the plane,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,through AH ought to lift the bottom of the crystal. Let the plane of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"this figure represent separately the section through Q_q_ and CL, in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which section there is also the ray RC, and let the semi-elliptic","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"plane through Q_q_ and CM be inclined to the former, as previously, by","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,an angle of 6 degrees 40 minutes; and in this plane CI is then the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,refraction of the ray RC.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"If now one considers the point I as at the bottom of the crystal, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that it is viewed by the rays ICR, _Icr_, refracted equally at the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"points C_c_, which should be equally distant from D, and that these","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,rays meet the two eyes at R_r_; it is certain that the point I will,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"appear raised to S where the straight lines RC, _rc_, meet; which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"point S is in DP, perpendicular to Q_q_. And if upon DP there is drawn","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the perpendicular IP, which will lie at the bottom of the crystal, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,length SP will be the apparent elevation of the point I above the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,bottom.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Let there be described on Q_q_ a semicircle cutting the ray CR at B,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,from which BV is drawn perpendicular to Q_q_; and let the proportion,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of the refraction for this section be, as before, that of the line N","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,to the semi-diameter CQ.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Then as N is to CQ so is VC to CD, as appears by the method of finding","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the refraction which we have shown above, Article 31; but as VC is to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"CD, so is VB to DS. Then as N is to CQ, so is VB to DS. Let ML be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,perpendicular to CL. And because I suppose the eyes R_r_ to be distant,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"about a foot or so from the crystal, and consequently the angle RS_r_","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"very small, VB may be considered as equal to the semi-diameter CQ, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,DP as equal to CL; then as N is to CQ so is CQ to DS. But N is valued,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"at 156,962 parts, of which CM contains 100,000 and CQ 105,032. Then DS","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"will have 70,283. But CL is 99,324, being the sine of the complement","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of the angle MCL which is 6 degrees 40 minutes; CM being supposed as,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"radius. Then DP, considered as equal to CL, will be to DS as 99,324 to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"70,283. And so the elevation of the point I by the refraction of this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,section is known.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,41. Now let there be represented the other section through EF in the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"figure before the preceding one; and let CM_g_ be the semi-ellipse,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"considered in Articles 27 and 28, which is made by cutting a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spheroidal wave having centre C. Let the point I, taken in this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ellipse, be imagined again at the bottom of the Crystal; and let it be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"viewed by the refracted rays ICR, I_cr_, which go to the two eyes; CR","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and _cr_ being equally inclined to the surface of the crystal G_g_.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"This being so, if one draws ID parallel to CM, which I suppose to be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the refraction of the perpendicular ray incident at the point C, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"distances DC, D_c_, will be equal, as is easy to see by that which has","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,been demonstrated in Article 28. Now it is certain that the point I,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"should appear at S where the straight lines RC, _rc_, meet when","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,prolonged; and that this point will fall in the line DP perpendicular,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to G_g_. If one draws IP perpendicular to this DP, it will be the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,distance PS which will mark the apparent elevation of the point I. Let,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"there be described on G_g_ a semicircle cutting CR at B, from which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,let BV be drawn perpendicular to G_g_; and let N to GC be the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"proportion of the refraction in this section, as in Article 28. Since","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"then CI is the refraction of the radius BC, and DI is parallel to CM,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"VC must be to CD as N to GC, according to what has been demonstrated","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,in Article 31. But as VC is to CD so is BV to DS. Let ML be drawn,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perpendicular to CL. And because I consider, again, the eyes to be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"distant above the crystal, BV is deemed equal to the semi-diameter CG;","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and hence DS will be a third proportional to the lines N and CG: also,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"DP will be deemed equal to CL. Now CG consisting of 98,778 parts, of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which CM contains 100,000, N is taken as 156,962. Then DS will be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"62,163. But CL is also determined, and contains 99,324 parts, as has","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,been said in Articles 34 and 40. Then the ratio of PD to DS will be as,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"99,324 to 62,163. And thus one knows the elevation of the point at the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,bottom I by the refraction of this section; and it appears that this,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,elevation is greater than that by the refraction of the preceding,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"section, since the ratio of PD to DS was there as 99,324 to 70,283.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"But by the regular refraction of the crystal, of which we have above","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"said that the proportion is 5 to 3, the elevation of the point I, or","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"P, from the bottom, will be 2/5 of the height DP; as appears by this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"figure, where the point P being viewed by the rays PCR, P_cr_,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refracted equally at the surface C_c_, this point must needs appear","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to be at S, in the perpendicular PD where the lines RC, _rc_, meet","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"when prolonged: and one knows that the line PC is to CS as 5 to 3,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,since they are to one another as the sine of the angle CSP or DSC is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,to the sine of the angle SPC. And because the ratio of PD to DS is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"deemed the same as that of PC to CS, the two eyes Rr being supposed","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"very far above the crystal, the elevation PS will thus be 2/5 of PD.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"42. If one takes a straight line AB for the thickness of the crystal,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"its point B being at the bottom, and if one divides it at the points","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"C, D, E, according to the proportions of the elevations found, making","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"AE 3/5 of AB, AB to AC as 99,324 to 70,283, and AB to AD as 99,324 to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"62,163, these points will divide AB as in this figure. And it will be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,found that this agrees perfectly with experiment; that is to say by,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,placing the eyes above in the plane which cuts the crystal according,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to the shorter diameter of the rhombus, the regular refraction will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"lift up the letters to E; and one will see the bottom, and the letters","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"over which it is placed, lifted up to D by the irregular refraction.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,But by placing the eyes above in the plane which cuts the crystal,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"according to the longer diameter of the rhombus, the regular","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,refraction will lift the letters to E as before; but the irregular,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refraction will make them, at the same time, appear lifted up only to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,C; and in such a way that the interval CE will be quadruple the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"interval ED, which one previously saw.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,43. I have only to make the remark here that in both the positions of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the eyes the images caused by the irregular refraction do not appear,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"directly below those which proceed from the regular refraction, but","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,they are separated from them by being more distant from the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"equilateral solid angle of the Crystal. That follows, indeed, from all","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that has been hitherto demonstrated about the irregular refraction;,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and it is particularly shown by these last demonstrations, from which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,one sees that the point I appears by irregular refraction at S in the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perpendicular line DP, in which line also the image of the point P","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ought to appear by regular refraction, but not the image of the point","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"I, which will be almost directly above the same point, and higher than","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,S.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,But as to the apparent elevation of the point I in other positions of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the eyes above the crystal, besides the two positions which we have","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"just examined, the image of that point by the irregular refraction","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"will always appear between the two heights of D and C, passing from","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,one to the other as one turns one's self around about the immovable,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"crystal, while looking down from above. And all this is still found","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"conformable to our hypothesis, as any one can assure himself after I","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,shall have shown here the way of finding the irregular refractions,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which appear in all other sections of the crystal, besides the two","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which we have considered. Let us suppose one of the faces of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"crystal, in which let there be the Ellipse HDE, the centre C of which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"is also the centre of the spheroid HME in which the light spreads, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of which the said Ellipse is the section. And let the incident ray be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"RC, the refraction of which it is required to find.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Let there be taken a plane passing through the ray RC and which is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perpendicular to the plane of the ellipse HDE, cutting it along the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,straight line BCK; and having in the same plane through RC made CO,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perpendicular to CR, let OK be adjusted across the angle OCK, so as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to be perpendicular to OC and equal to the line N, which I suppose to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,measure the travel of the light in air during the time that it spreads,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,in the crystal through the spheroid HDEM. Then in the plane of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Ellipse HDE let KT be drawn, through the point K, perpendicular to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,BCK. Now if one conceives a plane drawn through the straight line KT,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and touching the spheroid HME at I, the straight line CI will be the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refraction of the ray RC, as is easy to deduce from that which has","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,been demonstrated in Article 36.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,But it must be shown how one can determine the point of contact I. Let,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,there be drawn parallel to the line KT a line HF which touches the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Ellipse HDE, and let this point of contact be at H. And having drawn a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"straight line along CH to meet KT at T, let there be imagined a plane","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,passing through the same CH and through CM (which I suppose to be the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refraction of the perpendicular ray), which makes in the spheroid the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,elliptical section HME. It is certain that the plane which will pass,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"through the straight line KT, and which will touch the spheroid, will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"touch it at a point in the Ellipse HME, according to the Lemma which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,will be demonstrated at the end of the Chapter. Now this point is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"necessarily the point I which is sought, since the plane drawn through","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,TK can touch the spheroid at one point only. And this point I is easy,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to determine, since it is needful only to draw from the point T, which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"is in the plane of this Ellipse, the tangent TI, in the way shown","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"previously. For the Ellipse HME is given, and its conjugate","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"semi-diameters are CH and CM; because a straight line drawn through M,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"parallel to HE, touches the Ellipse HME, as follows from the fact that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"a plane taken through M, and parallel to the plane HDE, touches the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spheroid at that point M, as is seen from Articles 27 and 23. For the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"rest, the position of this ellipse, with respect to the plane through","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the ray RC and through CK, is also given; from which it will be easy","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to find the position of CI, the refraction corresponding to the ray","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,RC.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Now it must be noted that the same ellipse HME serves to find the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,refractions of any other ray which may be in the plane through RC and,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"CK. Because every plane, parallel to the straight line HF, or TK,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which will touch the spheroid, will touch it in this ellipse,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,according to the Lemma quoted a little before.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"I have investigated thus, in minute detail, the properties of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"irregular refraction of this Crystal, in order to see whether each","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,phenomenon that is deduced from our hypothesis accords with that which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,is observed in fact. And this being so it affords no slight proof of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the truth of our suppositions and principles. But what I am going to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,add here confirms them again marvellously. It is this: that there are,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"different sections of this Crystal, the surfaces of which, thereby","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"produced, give rise to refractions precisely such as they ought to be,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and as I had foreseen them, according to the preceding Theory.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"In order to explain what these sections are, let ABKF _be_ the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"principal section through the axis of the crystal ACK, in which there","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,will also be the axis SS of a spheroidal wave of light spreading in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the crystal from the centre C; and the straight line which cuts SS,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"through the middle and at right angles, namely PP, will be one of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,major diameters.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration: {Section ABKF}],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Now as in the natural section of the crystal, made by a plane parallel","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to two opposite faces, which plane is here represented by the line GG,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the refraction of the surfaces which are produced by it will be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"governed by the hemi-spheroids GNG, according to what has been","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"explained in the preceding Theory. Similarly, cutting the Crystal","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"through NN, by a plane perpendicular to the parallelogram ABKF, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,refraction of the surfaces will be governed by the hemi-spheroids NGN.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"And if one cuts it through PP, perpendicularly to the said","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"parallelogram, the refraction of the surfaces ought to be governed by","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the hemi-spheroids PSP, and so for others. But I saw that if the plane","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"NN was almost perpendicular to the plane GG, making the angle NCG,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which is on the side A, an angle of 90 degrees 40 minutes, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"hemi-spheroids NGN would become similar to the hemi-spheroids GNG,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,since the planes NN and GG were equally inclined by an angle of 45,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"degrees 20 minutes to the axis SS. In consequence it must needs be, if","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"our theory is true, that the surfaces which the section through NN","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,produces should effect the same refractions as the surfaces of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,section through GG. And not only the surfaces of the section NN but,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,all other sections produced by planes which might be inclined to the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,axis at an angle equal to 45 degrees 20 minutes. So that there are an,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,infinitude of planes which ought to produce precisely the same,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refractions as the natural surfaces of the crystal, or as the section","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,parallel to any one of those surfaces which are made by cleavage.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"I saw also that by cutting it by a plane taken through PP, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perpendicular to the axis SS, the refraction of the surfaces ought to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,be such that the perpendicular ray should suffer thereby no deviation;,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and that for oblique rays there would always be an irregular,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refraction, differing from the regular, and by which objects placed","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,beneath the crystal would be less elevated than by that other,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,refraction.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"That, similarly, by cutting the crystal by any plane through the axis","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"SS, such as the plane of the figure is, the perpendicular ray ought to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,suffer no refraction; and that for oblique rays there were different,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,measures for the irregular refraction according to the situation of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the plane in which the incident ray was.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Now these things were found in fact so; and, after that, I could not","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,doubt that a similar success could be met with everywhere. Whence I,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,concluded that one might form from this crystal solids similar to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"those which are its natural forms, which should produce, at all their","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"surfaces, the same regular and irregular refractions as the natural","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"surfaces, and which nevertheless would cleave in quite other ways, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,not in directions parallel to any of their faces. That out of it one,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"would be able to fashion pyramids, having their base square,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"pentagonal, hexagonal, or with as many sides as one desired, all the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,surfaces of which should have the same refractions as the natural,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"surfaces of the crystal, except the base, which will not refract the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,perpendicular ray. These surfaces will each make an angle of 45,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"degrees 20 minutes with the axis of the crystal, and the base will be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the section perpendicular to the axis.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"That, finally, one could also fashion out of it triangular prisms, or","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"prisms with as many sides as one would, of which neither the sides nor","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the bases would refract the perpendicular ray, although they would yet","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,all cause double refraction for oblique rays. The cube is included,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"amongst these prisms, the bases of which are sections perpendicular to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the axis of the crystal, and the sides are sections parallel to the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,same axis.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,From all this it further appears that it is not at all in the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"disposition of the layers of which this crystal seems to be composed,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and according to which it splits in three different senses, that the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,cause resides of its irregular refraction; and that it would be in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,vain to wish to seek it there.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,But in order that any one who has some of this stone may be able to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"find, by his own experience, the truth of what I have just advanced, I","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"will state here the process of which I have made use to cut it, and to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"polish it. Cutting is easy by the slicing wheels of lapidaries, or in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the way in which marble is sawn: but polishing is very difficult, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,by employing the ordinary means one more often depolishes the surfaces,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,than makes them lucent.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"After many trials, I have at last found that for this service no plate","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of metal must be used, but a piece of mirror glass made matt and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"depolished. Upon this, with fine sand and water, one smoothes the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"crystal little by little, in the same way as spectacle glasses, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"polishes it simply by continuing the work, but ever reducing the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"material. I have not, however, been able to give it perfect clarity","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and transparency; but the evenness which the surfaces acquire enables,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,one to observe in them the effects of refraction better than in those,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"made by cleaving the stone, which always have some inequality.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Even when the surface is only moderately smoothed, if one rubs it over","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"with a little oil or white of egg, it becomes quite transparent, so","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that the refraction is discerned in it quite distinctly. And this aid,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,is specially necessary when it is wished to polish the natural,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,surfaces to remove the inequalities; because one cannot render them,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"lucent equally with the surfaces of other sections, which take a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,polish so much the better the less nearly they approximate to these,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,natural planes.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Before finishing the treatise on this Crystal, I will add one more","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,marvellous phenomenon which I discovered after having written all the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"foregoing. For though I have not been able till now to find its cause,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"I do not for that reason wish to desist from describing it, in order","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,to give opportunity to others to investigate it. It seems that it will,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,be necessary to make still further suppositions besides those which I,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,have made; but these will not for all that cease to keep their,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,probability after having been confirmed by so many tests.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"The phenomenon is, that by taking two pieces of this crystal and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"applying them one over the other, or rather holding them with a space","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"between the two, if all the sides of one are parallel to those of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"other, then a ray of light, such as AB, is divided into two in the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"first piece, namely into BD and BC, following the two refractions,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,regular and irregular. On penetrating thence into the other piece,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,each ray will pass there without further dividing itself in two; but,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that one which underwent the regular refraction, as here DG, will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"undergo again only a regular refraction at GH; and the other, CE, an","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,irregular refraction at EF. And the same thing occurs not only in this,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"disposition, but also in all those cases in which the principal","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"section of each of the pieces is situated in one and the same plane,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,without it being needful for the two neighbouring surfaces to be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"parallel. Now it is marvellous why the rays CE and DG, incident from","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the air on the lower crystal, do not divide themselves the same as the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,first ray AB. One would say that it must be that the ray DG in passing,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,through the upper piece has lost something which is necessary to move,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the matter which serves for the irregular refraction; and that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,likewise CE has lost that which was necessary to move the matter,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which serves for regular refraction: but there is yet another thing,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which upsets this reasoning. It is that when one disposes the two,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,crystals in such a way that the planes which constitute the principal,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"sections intersect one another at right angles, whether the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"neighbouring surfaces are parallel or not, then the ray which has come","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"by the regular refraction, as DG, undergoes only an irregular","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,refraction in the lower piece; and on the contrary the ray which has,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"come by the irregular refraction, as CE, undergoes only a regular","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,refraction.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"But in all the infinite other positions, besides those which I have","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"just stated, the rays DG, CE, divide themselves anew each one into","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"two, by refraction in the lower crystal so that from the single ray AB","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"there are four, sometimes of equal brightness, sometimes some much","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"less bright than others, according to the varying agreement in the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,positions of the crystals: but they do not appear to have all together,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,more light than the single ray AB.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"When one considers here how, while the rays CE, DG, remain the same,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"it depends on the position that one gives to the lower piece, whether","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"it divides them both in two, or whether it does not divide them, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"yet how the ray AB above is always divided, it seems that one is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"obliged to conclude that the waves of light, after having passed","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"through the first crystal, acquire a certain form or disposition in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"virtue of which, when meeting the texture of the second crystal, in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"certain positions, they can move the two different kinds of matter","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which serve for the two species of refraction; and when meeting the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,second crystal in another position are able to move only one of these,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"kinds of matter. But to tell how this occurs, I have hitherto found","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,nothing which satisfies me.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Leaving then to others this research, I pass to what I have to say","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"touching the cause of the extraordinary figure of this crystal, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"why it cleaves easily in three different senses, parallel to any one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of its surfaces.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"There are many bodies, vegetable, mineral, and congealed salts, which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,are formed with certain regular angles and figures. Thus among flowers,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"there are many which have their leaves disposed in ordered polygons,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to the number of 3, 4, 5, or 6 sides, but not more. This well deserves","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to be investigated, both as to the polygonal figure, and as to why it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,does not exceed the number 6.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Rock Crystal grows ordinarily in hexagonal bars, and diamonds are","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,found which occur with a square point and polished surfaces. There is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"a species of small flat stones, piled up directly upon one another,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which are all of pentagonal figure with rounded angles, and the sides","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,a little folded inwards. The grains of gray salt which are formed from,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"sea water affect the figure, or at least the angle, of the cube; and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"in the congelations of other salts, and in that of sugar, there are","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,found other solid angles with perfectly flat faces. Small snowflakes,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"almost always fall in little stars with 6 points, and sometimes in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"hexagons with straight sides. And I have often observed, in water","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which is beginning to freeze, a kind of flat and thin foliage of ice,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the middle ray of which throws out branches inclined at an angle of 60,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,degrees. All these things are worthy of being carefully investigated,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,to ascertain how and by what artifice nature there operates. But it is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,not now my intention to treat fully of this matter. It seems that in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,general the regularity which occurs in these productions comes from,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the arrangement of the small invisible equal particles of which they,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"are composed. And, coming to our Iceland Crystal, I say that if there","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"were a pyramid such as ABCD, composed of small rounded corpuscles, not","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spherical but flattened spheroids, such as would be made by the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,rotation of the ellipse GH around its lesser diameter EF (of which the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ratio to the greater diameter is very nearly that of 1 to the square,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,root of 8)--I say that then the solid angle of the point D would be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"equal to the obtuse and equilateral angle of this Crystal. I say,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"further, that if these corpuscles were lightly stuck together, on","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,breaking this pyramid it would break along faces parallel to those,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that make its point: and by this means, as it is easy to see, it would","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,produce prisms similar to those of the same crystal as this other,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,figure represents. The reason is that when broken in this fashion a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,whole layer separates easily from its neighbouring layer since each,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,spheroid has to be detached only from the three spheroids of the next,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,layer; of which three there is but one which touches it on its,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"flattened surface, and the other two at the edges. And the reason why","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the surfaces separate sharp and polished is that if any spheroid of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the neighbouring surface would come out by attaching itself to the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"surface which is being separated, it would be needful for it to detach","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"itself from six other spheroids which hold it locked, and four of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which press it by these flattened surfaces. Since then not only the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,angles of our crystal but also the manner in which it splits agree,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,precisely with what is observed in the assemblage composed of such,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spheroids, there is great reason to believe that the particles are","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,shaped and ranged in the same way.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration: {Pyramid and section of spheroids}],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,There is even probability enough that the prisms of this crystal are,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"produced by the breaking up of pyramids, since Mr. Bartholinus relates","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that he occasionally found some pieces of triangularly pyramidal,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,figure. But when a mass is composed interiorly only of these little,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spheroids thus piled up, whatever form it may have exteriorly, it is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"certain, by the same reasoning which I have just explained, that if","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,broken it would produce similar prisms. It remains to be seen whether,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"there are other reasons which confirm our conjecture, and whether","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,there are none which are repugnant to it.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration: {paralleloid arrangement of spheroids with planes of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,potential cleavage}],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"It may be objected that this crystal, being so composed, might be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,capable of cleavage in yet two more fashions; one of which would be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"along planes parallel to the base of the pyramid, that is to say to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the triangle ABC; the other would be parallel to a plane the trace of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which is marked by the lines GH, HK, KL. To which I say that both the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"one and the other, though practicable, are more difficult than those","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which were parallel to any one of the three planes of the pyramid; and,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that therefore, when striking on the crystal in order to break it, it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ought always to split rather along these three planes than along the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,two others. When one has a number of spheroids of the form above,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"described, and ranges them in a pyramid, one sees why the two methods","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of division are more difficult. For in the case of that division which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"would be parallel to the base, each spheroid would be obliged to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,detach itself from three others which it touches upon their flattened,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"surfaces, which hold more strongly than the contacts at the edges. And","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"besides that, this division will not occur along entire layers,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,because each of the spheroids of a layer is scarcely held at all by,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the 6 of the same layer that surround it, since they only touch it at","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the edges; so that it adheres readily to the neighbouring layer, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the others to it, for the same reason; and this causes uneven","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,surfaces. Also one sees by experiment that when grinding down the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"crystal on a rather rough stone, directly on the equilateral solid","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"angle, one verily finds much facility in reducing it in this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"direction, but much difficulty afterwards in polishing the surface","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which has been flattened in this manner.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"As for the other method of division along the plane GHKL, it will be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,seen that each spheroid would have to detach itself from four of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"neighbouring layer, two of which touch it on the flattened surfaces,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and two at the edges. So that this division is likewise more difficult,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,than that which is made parallel to one of the surfaces of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"crystal; where, as we have said, each spheroid is detached from only","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,three of the neighbouring layer: of which three there is one only,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which touches it on the flattened surface, and the other two at the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,edges only.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"However, that which has made me know that in the crystal there are","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"layers in this last fashion, is that in a piece weighing half a pound","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which I possess, one sees that it is split along its length, as is the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,above-mentioned prism by the plane GHKL; as appears by colours of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Iris extending throughout this whole plane although the two pieces,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,still hold together. All this proves then that the composition of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,crystal is such as we have stated. To which I again add this,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,experiment; that if one passes a knife scraping along any one of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"natural surfaces, and downwards as it were from the equilateral obtuse","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"angle, that is to say from the apex of the pyramid, one finds it quite","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,hard; but by scraping in the opposite sense an incision is easily,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,made. This follows manifestly from the situation of the small,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spheroids; over which, in the first manner, the knife glides; but in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the other manner it seizes them from beneath almost as if they were,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the scales of a fish.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,I will not undertake to say anything touching the way in which so many,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"corpuscles all equal and similar are generated, nor how they are set","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,in such beautiful order; whether they are formed first and then,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"assembled, or whether they arrange themselves thus in coming into","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"being and as fast as they are produced, which seems to me more","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,probable. To develop truths so recondite there would be needed a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,knowledge of nature much greater than that which we have. I will add,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,only that these little spheroids could well contribute to form the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spheroids of the waves of light, here above supposed, these as well as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"those being similarly situated, and with their axes parallel.","Huygens, Christiaan"

14725,_Calculations which have been supposed in this Chapter_.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Mr. Bartholinus, in his treatise of this Crystal, puts at 101 degrees","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the obtuse angles of the faces, which I have stated to be 101 degrees","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,52 minutes. He states that he measured these angles directly on the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"crystal, which is difficult to do with ultimate exactitude, because","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the edges such as CA, CB, in this figure, are generally worn, and not","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"quite straight. For more certainty, therefore, I preferred to measure","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"actually the obtuse angle by which the faces CBDA, CBVF, are inclined","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to one another, namely the angle OCN formed by drawing CN","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perpendicular to FV, and CO perpendicular to DA. This angle OCN I","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"found to be 105 degrees; and its supplement CNP, to be 75 degrees, as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,it should be.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"To find from this the obtuse angle BCA, I imagined a sphere having its","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"centre at C, and on its surface a spherical triangle, formed by the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,intersection of three planes which enclose the solid angle C. In this,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"equilateral triangle, which is ABF in this other figure, I see that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"each of the angles should be 105 degrees, namely equal to the angle","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,OCN; and that each of the sides should be of as many degrees as the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"angle ACB, or ACF, or BCF. Having then drawn the arc FQ perpendicular","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to the side AB, which it divides equally at Q, the triangle FQA has a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"right angle at Q, the angle A 105 degrees, and F half as much, namely","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,52 degrees 30 minutes; whence the hypotenuse AF is found to be 101,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,degrees 52 minutes. And this arc AF is the measure of the angle ACF in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the figure of the crystal.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"In the same figure, if the plane CGHF cuts the crystal so that it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"divides the obtuse angles ACB, MHV, in the middle, it is stated, in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Article 10, that the angle CFH is 70 degrees 57 minutes. This again is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"easily shown in the same spherical triangle ABF, in which it appears","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that the arc FQ is as many degrees as the angle GCF in the crystal,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the supplement of which is the angle CFH. Now the arc FQ is found to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"be 109 degrees 3 minutes. Then its supplement, 70 degrees 57 minutes,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,is the angle CFH.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"It was stated, in Article 26, that the straight line CS, which in the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"preceding figure is CH, being the axis of the crystal, that is to say","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"being equally inclined to the three sides CA, CB, CF, the angle GCH is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,45 degrees 20 minutes. This is also easily calculated by the same,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,spherical triangle. For by drawing the other arc AD which cuts BF,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"equally, and intersects FQ at S, this point will be the centre of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,triangle. And it is easy to see that the arc SQ is the measure of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,angle GCH in the figure which represents the crystal. Now in the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"triangle QAS, which is right-angled, one knows also the angle A, which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"is 52 degrees 30 minutes, and the side AQ 50 degrees 56 minutes;","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,whence the side SQ is found to be 45 degrees 20 minutes.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,In Article 27 it was required to show that PMS being an ellipse the,"Huygens, Christiaan"

14725,"that the angle MCL which CM makes with CL, perpendicular on DM, is 6","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"degrees 40 minutes, and its semi-minor axis CS making with CG (which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"is parallel to MD) an angle GCS of 45 degrees 20 minutes, it was","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"required to show, I say, that, CM being 100,000 parts, PC the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"semi-major diameter of this ellipse is 105,032 parts, and CS, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"semi-minor diameter, 93,410.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Let CP and CS be prolonged and meet the tangent DM at D and Z; and,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,from the point of contact M let MN and MO be drawn as perpendiculars,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to CP and CS. Now because the angles SCP, GCL, are right angles, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,angle PCL will be equal to GCS which was 45 degrees 20 minutes. And,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"deducting the angle LCM, which is 6 degrees 40 minutes, from LCP,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which is 45 degrees 20 minutes, there remains MCP, 38 degrees 40","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"minutes. Considering then CM as a radius of 100,000 parts, MN, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"sine of 38 degrees 40 minutes, will be 62,479. And in the right-angled","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"triangle MND, MN will be to ND as the radius of the Tables is to the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,tangent of 45 degrees 20 minutes (because the angle NMD is equal to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"DCL, or GCS); that is to say as 100,000 to 101,170: whence results ND","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"63,210. But NC is 78,079 of the same parts, CM being 100,000, because","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"NC is the sine of the complement of the angle MCP, which was 38","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"degrees 40 minutes. Then the whole line DC is 141,289; and CP, which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"is a mean proportional between DC and CN, since MD touches the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Ellipse, will be 105,032.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Similarly, because the angle OMZ is equal to CDZ, or LCZ, which is 44","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"degrees 40 minutes, being the complement of GCS, it follows that, as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the radius of the Tables is to the tangent of 44 degrees 40 minutes,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"so will OM 78,079 be to OZ 77,176. But OC is 62,479 of these same","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"parts of which CM is 100,000, because it is equal to MN, the sine of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the angle MCP, which is 38 degrees 40 minutes. Then the whole line CZ","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"is 139,655; and CS, which is a mean proportional between CZ and CO","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"will be 93,410.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"At the same place it was stated that GC was found to be 98,779 parts.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"To prove this, let PE be drawn in the same figure parallel to DM, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,meeting CM at E. In the right-angled triangle CLD the side CL is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"99,324 (CM being 100,000), because CL is the sine of the complement of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the angle LCM, which is 6 degrees 40 minutes. And since the angle LCD","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"is 45 degrees 20 minutes, being equal to GCS, the side LD is found to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"be 100,486: whence deducting ML 11,609 there will remain MD 88,877.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Now as CD (which was 141,289) is to DM 88,877, so will CP 105,032 be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to PE 66,070. But as the rectangle MEH (or rather the difference of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the squares on CM and CE) is to the square on MC, so is the square on","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,PE to the square on C_g_; then also as the difference of the squares,"Huygens, Christiaan"

14725,"similarly disposed, and will have their centres K, N, R, in one and","Huygens, Christiaan"

14725,"centre of the spheroid, and which cuts the planes of the three said","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Ellipses at right angles: for all this is manifest by proposition 15,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of the book of Conoids and Spheroids of Archimedes. Further, the two","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"latter planes, which are drawn through the points O and A, will also,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"by cutting the planes which touch the spheroid in these same points,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"generate straight lines, as OH and AS, which will, as is easy to see,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"be parallel to BM; and all three, BM, OH, AS, will touch the Ellipses","Huygens, Christiaan"

14725,"of these ellipses, and at the same time in the planes which touch the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spheroid. If now from these points B, O, A, there are drawn the","Huygens, Christiaan"

14725,"and if through these centres there are drawn also the diameters LD,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"PP, QQ, parallel to the tangents BM, OH, AS; these will be conjugate","Huygens, Christiaan"

14725,"similar and similarly disposed, and have their diameters LD, PP, QQ","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"parallel, it is certain that their conjugate diameters BK, ON, AR,","Huygens, Christiaan"

14725,ON THE FIGURES OF THE TRANSPARENT BODIES,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Which serve for Refraction and for Reflexion,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,After having explained how the properties of reflexion and refraction,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"follow from what we have supposed concerning the nature of light, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of opaque bodies, and of transparent media, I will here set forth a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"very easy and natural way of deducing, from the same principles, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"true figures which serve, either by reflexion or by refraction, to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"collect or disperse the rays of light, as may be desired. For though I","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"do not see yet that there are means of making use of these figures, so","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"far as relates to Refraction, not only because of the difficulty of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,shaping the glasses of Telescopes with the requisite exactitude,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"according to these figures, but also because there exists in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,refraction itself a property which hinders the perfect concurrence of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the rays, as Mr. Newton has very well proved by experiment, I will yet","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"not desist from relating the invention, since it offers itself, so to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"speak, of itself, and because it further confirms our Theory of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refraction, by the agreement which here is found between the refracted","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ray and the reflected ray. Besides, it may occur that some one in the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,future will discover in it utilities which at present are not seen.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"To proceed then to these figures, let us suppose first that it is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,desired to find a surface CDE which shall reassemble at a point B rays,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,coming from another point A; and that the summit of the surface shall,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"be the given point D in the straight line AB. I say that, whether by","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"reflexion or by refraction, it is only necessary to make this surface","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,such that the path of the light from the point A to all points of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"curved line CDE, and from these to the point of concurrence (as here","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the path along the straight lines AC, CB, along AL, LB, and along AD,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"DB), shall be everywhere traversed in equal times: by which principle","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the finding of these curves becomes very easy.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"So far as relates to the reflecting surface, since the sum of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"lines AC, CB ought to be equal to that of AD, DB, it appears that DCE","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ought to be an ellipse; and for refraction, the ratio of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,velocities of waves of light in the media A and B being supposed to be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"known, for example that of 3 to 2 (which is the same, as we have","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"shown, as the ratio of the Sines in the refraction), it is only","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,necessary to make DH equal to 3/2 of DB; and having after that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"described from the centre A some arc FC, cutting DB at F, then","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,describe another from centre B with its semi-diameter BX equal to 2/3,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of FH; and the point of intersection of the two arcs will be one of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the points required, through which the curve should pass. For this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"point, having been found in this fashion, it is easy forthwith to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"demonstrate that the time along AC, CB, will be equal to the time","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"along AD, DB.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,For assuming that the line AD represents the time which the light,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"takes to traverse this same distance AD in air, it is evident that DH,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"equal to 3/2 of DB, will represent the time of the light along DB in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the medium, because it needs here more time in proportion as its speed","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,is slower. Therefore the whole line AH will represent the time along,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"AD, DB. Similarly the line AC or AF will represent the time along AC;","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and FH being by construction equal to 3/2 of CB, it will represent the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,time along CB in the medium; and in consequence the whole line AH will,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"represent also the time along AC, CB. Whence it appears that the time","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"along AC, CB, is equal to the time along AD, DB. And similarly it can","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"be shown if L and K are other points in the curve CDE, that the times","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"along AL, LB, and along AK, KB, are always represented by the line AH,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and therefore equal to the said time along AD, DB.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"In order to show further that the surfaces, which these curves will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"generate by revolution, will direct all the rays which reach them from","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the point A in such wise that they tend towards B, let there be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"supposed a point K in the curve, farther from D than C is, but such","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that the straight line AK falls from outside upon the curve which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,serves for the refraction; and from the centre B let the arc KS be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"described, cutting BD at S, and the straight line CB at R; and from","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the centre A describe the arc DN meeting AK at N.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Since the sums of the times along AK, KB, and along AC, CB are equal,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"if from the former sum one deducts the time along KB, and if from the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"other one deducts the time along RB, there will remain the time along","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"AK as equal to the time along the two parts AC, CR. Consequently in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the time that the light has come along AK it will also have come along,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"AC and will in addition have made, in the medium from the centre C, a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"partial spherical wave, having a semi-diameter equal to CR. And this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"wave will necessarily touch the circumference KS at R, since CB cuts","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"this circumference at right angles. Similarly, having taken any other","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"point L in the curve, one can show that in the same time as the light","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,passes along AL it will also have come along AL and in addition will,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"have made a partial wave, from the centre L, which will touch the same","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,circumference KS. And so with all other points of the curve CDE. Then,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,at the moment that the light reaches K the arc KRS will be the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"termination of the movement, which has spread from A through DCK. And","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,thus this same arc will constitute in the medium the propagation of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the wave emanating from A; which wave may be represented by the arc,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"DN, or by any other nearer the centre A. But all the pieces of the arc","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,KRS are propagated successively along straight lines which are,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perpendicular to them, that is to say, which tend to the centre B (for","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that can be demonstrated in the same way as we have proved above that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the pieces of spherical waves are propagated along the straight lines,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"coming from their centre), and these progressions of the pieces of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,waves constitute the rays themselves of light. It appears then that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,all these rays tend here towards the point B.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"One might also determine the point C, and all the others, in this","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"curve which serves for the refraction, by dividing DA at G in such a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"way that DG is 2/3 of DA, and describing from the centre B any arc CX","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which cuts BD at N, and another from the centre A with its","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"semi-diameter AF equal to 3/2 of GX; or rather, having described, as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"before, the arc CX, it is only necessary to make DF equal to 3/2 of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"DX, and from-the centre A to strike the arc FC; for these two","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"constructions, as may be easily known, come back to the first one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which was shown before. And it is manifest by the last method that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"this curve is the same that Mr. Des Cartes has given in his Geometry,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and which he calls the first of his Ovals.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"It is only a part of this oval which serves for the refraction,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"namely, the part DK, ending at K, if AK is the tangent. As to the,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"other part, Des Cartes has remarked that it could serve for","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"reflexions, if there were some material of a mirror of such a nature","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that by its means the force of the rays (or, as we should say, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"velocity of the light, which he could not say, since he held that the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,movement of light was instantaneous) could be augmented in the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,proportion of 3 to 2. But we have shown that in our way of explaining,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"reflexion, such a thing could not arise from the matter of the mirror,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and it is entirely impossible.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"

14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"From what has been demonstrated about this oval, it will be easy to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,find the figure which serves to collect to a point incident parallel,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"rays. For by supposing just the same construction, but the point A","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"infinitely distant, giving parallel rays, our oval becomes a true","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Ellipse, the construction of which differs in no way from that of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"oval, except that FC, which previously was an arc of a circle, is here","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"a straight line, perpendicular to DB. For the wave of light DN, being","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"likewise represented by a straight line, it will be seen that all the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"points of this wave, travelling as far as the surface KD along lines","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"parallel to DB, will advance subsequently towards the point B, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,will arrive there at the same time. As for the Ellipse which served,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"for reflexion, it is evident that it will here become a parabola,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,since its focus A may be regarded as infinitely distant from the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"other, B, which is here the focus of the parabola, towards which all","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the reflexions of rays parallel to AB tend. And the demonstration of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,these effects is just the same as the preceding.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,But that this curved line CDE which serves for refraction is an,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Ellipse, and is such that its major diameter is to the distance","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"between its foci as 3 to 2, which is the proportion of the refraction,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"can be easily found by the calculus of Algebra. For DB, which is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"given, being called _a_; its undetermined perpendicular DT being","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,called _x_; and TC _y_; FB will be _a - y_; CB will be sqrt(_xx + aa,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,-2ay + yy_). But the nature of the curve is such that 2/3 of TC,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"together with CB is equal to DB, as was stated in the last","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,construction: then the equation will be between _(2/3)y + sqrt(xx + aa,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"- 2ay + yy)_ and _a_; which being reduced, gives _(6/5)ay - yy_ equal","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to _(9/5)xx_; that is to say that having made DO equal to 6/5 of DB,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the rectangle DFO is equal to 9/5 of the square on FC. Whence it is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"seen that DC is an ellipse, of which the axis DO is to the parameter","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,as 9 to 5; and therefore the square on DO is to the square of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"distance between the foci as 9 to 9 - 5, that is to say 4; and finally","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the line DO will be to this distance as 3 to 2.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Again, if one supposes the point B to be infinitely distant, in lieu","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of our first oval we shall find that CDE is a true Hyperbola; which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,will make those rays become parallel which come from the point A. And,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,in consequence also those which are parallel within the transparent,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,body will be collected outside at the point A. Now it must be remarked,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that CX and KS become straight lines perpendicular to BA, because they","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,represent arcs of circles the centre of which is infinitely distant.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,And the intersection of the perpendicular CX with the arc FC will give,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the point C, one of those through which the curve ought to pass. And","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"this operates so that all the parts of the wave of light DN, coming to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"meet the surface KDE, will advance thence along parallels to KS and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,will arrive at this straight line at the same time; of which the proof,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,is again the same as that which served for the first oval. Besides one,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"finds by a calculation as easy as the preceding one, that CDE is here","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"a hyperbola of which the axis DO is 4/5 of AD, and the parameter","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,equal to AD. Whence it is easily proved that DO is to the distance,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,between the foci as 3 to 2.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"These are the two cases in which Conic sections serve for refraction,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and are the same which are explained, in his _Dioptrique_, by Des","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Cartes, who first found out the use of these lines in relation to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refraction, as also that of the Ovals the first of which we have","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,already set forth. The second oval is that which serves for rays that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"tend to a given point; in which oval, if the apex of the surface which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"receives the rays is D, it will happen that the other apex will be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"situated between B and A, or beyond A, according as the ratio of AD to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,DB is given of greater or lesser value. And in this latter case it is,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the same as that which Des Cartes calls his 3rd oval.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Now the finding and construction of this second oval is the same as,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that of the first, and the demonstration of its effect likewise. But","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,it is worthy of remark that in one case this oval becomes a perfect,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"circle, namely when the ratio of AD to DB is the same as the ratio of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the refractions, here as 3 to 2, as I observed a long time ago. The","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"4th oval, serving only for impossible reflexions, there is no need to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,set it forth.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"As for the manner in which Mr. Des Cartes discovered these lines,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"since he has given no explanation of it, nor any one else since that I","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"know of, I will say here, in passing, what it seems to me it must have","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,been. Let it be proposed to find the surface generated by the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"revolution of the curve KDE, which, receiving the incident rays coming","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to it from the point A, shall deviate them toward the point B. Then","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"considering this other curve as already known, and that its apex D is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"in the straight line AB, let us divide it up into an infinitude of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"small pieces by the points G, C, F; and having drawn from each of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"these points, straight lines towards A to represent the incident rays,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and other straight lines towards B, let there also be described with","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"centre A the arcs GL, CM, FN, DO, cutting the rays that come from A at","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"L, M, N, O; and from the points K, G, C, F, let there be described","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the arcs KQ, GR, CS, FT cutting the rays towards B at Q, R, S, T; and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,let us suppose that the straight line HKZ cuts the curve at K at,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,right-angles.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Then AK being an incident ray, and KB its refraction within the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"medium, it needs must be, according to the law of refraction which was","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"known to Mr. Des Cartes, that the sine of the angle ZKA should be to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the sine of the angle HKB as 3 to 2, supposing that this is the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"proportion of the refraction of glass; or rather, that the sine of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"angle KGL should have this same ratio to the sine of the angle GKQ,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"considering KG, GL, KQ as straight lines because of their smallness.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"But these sines are the lines KL and GQ, if GK is taken as the radius","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of the circle. Then LK ought to be to GQ as 3 to 2; and in the same,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ratio MG to CR, NC to FS, OF to DT. Then also the sum of all the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,antecedents to all the consequents would be as 3 to 2. Now by,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"prolonging the arc DO until it meets AK at X, KX is the sum of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"antecedents. And by prolonging the arc KQ till it meets AD at Y, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,sum of the consequents is DY. Then KX ought to be to DY as 3 to 2.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Whence it would appear that the curve KDE was of such a nature that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"having drawn from some point which had been assumed, such as K, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"straight lines KA, KB, the excess by which AK surpasses AD should be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to the excess of DB over KB, as 3 to 2. For it can similarly be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"demonstrated, by taking any other point in the curve, such as G, that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the excess of AG over AD, namely VG, is to the excess of BD over DG,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"namely DP, in this same ratio of 3 to 2. And following this principle","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Mr. Des Cartes constructed these curves in his _Geometric_; and he,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"easily recognized that in the case of parallel rays, these curves","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,became Hyperbolas and Ellipses.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Let us now return to our method and let us see how it leads without,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,difficulty to the finding of the curves which one side of the glass,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,requires when the other side is of a given figure; a figure not only,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"plane or spherical, or made by one of the conic sections (which is the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"restriction with which Des Cartes proposed this problem, leaving the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,solution to those who should come after him) but generally any figure,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"whatever: that is to say, one made by the revolution of any given","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,curved line to which one must merely know how to draw straight lines,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,as tangents.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Let the given figure be that made by the revolution of some curve such,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"as AK about the axis AV, and that this side of the glass receives rays","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"coming from the point L. Furthermore, let the thickness AB of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"middle of the glass be given, and the point F at which one desires the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"rays to be all perfectly reunited, whatever be the first refraction","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,occurring at the surface AK.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,I say that for this the sole requirement is that the outline BDK which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,constitutes the other surface shall be such that the path of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"light from the point L to the surface AK, and from thence to the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"surface BDK, and from thence to the point F, shall be traversed","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"everywhere in equal times, and in each case in a time equal to that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which the light employs, to pass along the straight line LF of which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the part AB is within the glass.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Let LG be a ray falling on the arc AK. Its refraction GV will be given,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,by means of the tangent which will be drawn at the point G. Now in GV,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the point D must be found such that FD together with 3/2 of DG and the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"straight line GL, may be equal to FB together with 3/2 of BA and the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"straight line AL; which, as is clear, make up a given length. Or","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"rather, by deducting from each the length of LG, which is also given,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,it will merely be needful to adjust FD up to the straight line VG in,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,such a way that FD together with 3/2 of DG is equal to a given,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"straight line, which is a quite easy plane problem: and the point D","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,will be one of those through which the curve BDK ought to pass. And,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"similarly, having drawn another ray LM, and found its refraction MO,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the point N will be found in this line, and so on as many times as one","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,desires.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"To demonstrate the effect of the curve, let there be described about","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the centre L the circular arc AH, cutting LG at H; and about the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,centre F the arc BP; and in AB let AS be taken equal to 2/3 of HG; and,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,SE equal to GD. Then considering AH as a wave of light emanating from,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the point L, it is certain that during the time in which its piece H","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,arrives at G the piece A will have advanced within the transparent,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"body only along AS; for I suppose, as above, the proportion of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,refraction to be as 3 to 2. Now we know that the piece of wave which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"is incident on G, advances thence along the line GD, since GV is the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,refraction of the ray LG. Then during the time that this piece of wave,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"has taken from G to D, the other piece which was at S has reached E,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"since GD, SE are equal. But while the latter will advance from E to B,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the piece of wave which was at D will have spread into the air its,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"partial wave, the semi-diameter of which, DC (supposing this wave to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"cut the line DF at C), will be 3/2 of EB, since the velocity of light","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,outside the medium is to that inside as 3 to 2. Now it is easy to show,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that this wave will touch the arc BP at this point C. For since, by","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"construction, FD + 3/2 DG + GL are equal to FB + 3/2 BA + AL; on","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"deducting the equals LH, LA, there will remain FD + 3/2 DG + GH equal","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to FB + 3/2 BA. And, again, deducting from one side GH, and from the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"other side 3/2 of AS, which are equal, there will remain FD with 3/2","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,DG equal to FB with 3/2 of BS. But 3/2 of DG are equal to 3/2 of ES;,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,then FD is equal to FB with 3/2 of BE. But DC was equal to 3/2 of EB;,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"then deducting these equal lengths from one side and from the other,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"there will remain CF equal to FB. And thus it appears that the wave,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the semi-diameter of which is DC, touches the arc BP at the moment","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,when the light coming from the point L has arrived at B along the line,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,LB. It can be demonstrated similarly that at this same moment the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"light that has come along any other ray, such as LM, MN, will have","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,propagated the movement which is terminated at the arc BP. Whence it,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"follows, as has been often said, that the propagation of the wave AH,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"after it has passed through the thickness of the glass, will be the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spherical wave BP, all the pieces of which ought to advance along","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"straight lines, which are the rays of light, to the centre F. Which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,was to be proved. Similarly these curved lines can be found in all the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"cases which can be proposed, as will be sufficiently shown by one or","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,two examples which I will add.,"Huygens, Christiaan"

14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,From the point L let there be drawn to some point of the given line,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"AK the straight line LG, which, being considered as a ray of light,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,its refraction GD will then be found. And this line being then,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"prolonged at one side or the other will meet the straight line BL, as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"here at V. Let there then be erected on AB the perpendicular BC, which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,will represent a wave of light coming from the infinitely distant,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"point F, since we have supposed the rays to be parallel. Then all the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,parts of this wave BC must arrive at the same time at the point L; or,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,rather all the parts of a wave emanating from the point L must arrive,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"at the same time at the straight line BC. And for that, it is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,necessary to find in the line VGD the point D such that having drawn,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"DC parallel to AB, the sum of CD, plus 3/2 of DG, plus GL may be equal","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to 3/2 of AB, plus AL: or rather, on deducting from both sides GL,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"which is given, CD plus 3/2 of DG must be equal to a given length;","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,which is a still easier problem than the preceding construction. The,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,point D thus found will be one of those through which the curve ought,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,to pass; and the proof will be the same as before. And by this it will,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"be proved that the waves which come from the point L, after having","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"passed through the glass KAKB, will take the form of straight lines,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,as BC; which is the same thing as saying that the rays will become,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,parallel. Whence it follows reciprocally that parallel rays falling on,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the surface KDB will be reassembled at the point L.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Again, let there be given the surface AK, of any desired form,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"generated by revolution about the axis AB, and let the thickness of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the glass at the middle be AB. Also let the point L be given in the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,axis behind the glass; and let it be supposed that the rays which fall,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"on the surface AK tend to this point, and that it is required to find","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the surface BD, which on their emergence from the glass turns them as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,if they came from the point F in front of the glass.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Having taken any point G in the line AK, and drawing the straight line","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"IGL, its part GI will represent one of the incident rays, the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refraction of which, GV, will then be found: and it is in this line","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that we must find the point D, one of those through which the curve DG","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,ought to pass. Let us suppose that it has been found: and about L as,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"centre let there be described GT, the arc of a circle cutting the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"straight line AB at T, in case the distance LG is greater than LA; for","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"otherwise the arc AH must be described about the same centre, cutting","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the straight line LG at H. This arc GT (or AH, in the other case) will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"represent an incident wave of light, the rays of which tend towards","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"L. Similarly, about the centre F let there be described the circular","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"arc DQ, which will represent a wave emanating from the point F.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"Then the wave TG, after having passed through the glass, must form the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,wave QD; and for this I observe that the time taken by the light along,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"GD in the glass must be equal to that taken along the three, TA, AB,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"and BQ, of which AB alone is within the glass. Or rather, having taken","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"AS equal to 2/3 of AT, I observe that 3/2 of GD ought to be equal to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"3/2 of SB, plus BQ; and, deducting both of them from FD or FQ, that FD","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,less 3/2 of GD ought to be equal to FB less 3/2 of SB. And this last,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,difference is a given length: and all that is required is to draw the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,straight line FD from the given point F to meet VG so that it may be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,thus. Which is a problem quite similar to that which served for the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"first of these constructions, where FD plus 3/2 of GD had to be equal","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,to a given length.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"In the demonstration it is to be observed that, since the arc BC falls","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"within the glass, there must be conceived an arc RX, concentric with","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,it and on the other side of QD. Then after it shall have been shown,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that the piece G of the wave GT arrives at D at the same time that the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"piece T arrives at Q, which is easily deduced from the construction,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,it will be evident as a consequence that the partial wave generated at,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the point D will touch the arc RX at the moment when the piece Q shall,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"have come to R, and that thus this arc will at the same moment be the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,termination of the movement that comes from the wave TG; whence all,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the rest may be concluded.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Having shown the method of finding these curved lines which serve for,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the perfect concurrence of the rays, there remains to be explained a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"notable thing touching the uncoordinated refraction of spherical,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"plane, and other surfaces: an effect which if ignored might cause some","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"doubt concerning what we have several times said, that rays of light","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,are straight lines which intersect at right angles the waves which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,travel along them.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"For in the case of rays which, for example, fall parallel upon a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spherical surface AFE, intersecting one another, after refraction, at","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"different points, as this figure represents; what can the waves of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"light be, in this transparent body, which are cut at right angles by","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the converging rays? For they can not be spherical. And what will,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,these waves become after the said rays begin to intersect one another?,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,It will be seen in the solution of this difficulty that something very,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"remarkable comes to pass herein, and that the waves do not cease to","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"persist though they do not continue entire, as when they cross the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,glasses designed according to the construction we have seen.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"According to what has been shown above, the straight line AD, which","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"has been drawn at the summit of the sphere, at right angles to the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"axis parallel to which the rays come, represents the wave of light;","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and in the time taken by its piece D to reach the spherical surface,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"AGE at E, its other parts will have met the same surface at F, G, H,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"etc., and will have also formed spherical partial waves of which these","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,points are the centres. And the surface EK which all those waves will,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"touch, will be the continuation of the wave AD in the sphere at the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,moment when the piece D has reached E. Now the line EK is not an arc,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"of a circle, but is a curved line formed as the evolute of another","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"curve ENC, which touches all the rays HL, GM, FO, etc., that are the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"refractions of the parallel rays, if we imagine laid over the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,convexity ENC a thread which in unwinding describes at its end E the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"said curve EK. For, supposing that this curve has been thus described,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"we will show that the said waves formed from the centres F, G, H,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"etc., will all touch it.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,It is certain that the curve EK and all the others described by the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"evolution of the curve ENC, with different lengths of thread, will cut","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"all the rays HL, GM, FO, etc., at right angles, and in such wise that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the parts of them intercepted between two such curves will all be,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,equal; for this follows from what has been demonstrated in our,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,treatise _de Motu Pendulorum_. Now imagining the incident rays as,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"being infinitely near to one another, if we consider two of them, as","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"RG, TF, and draw GQ perpendicular to RG, and if we suppose the curve","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,FS which intersects GM at P to have been described by evolution from,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the curve NC, beginning at F, as far as which the thread is supposed","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to extend, we may assume the small piece FP as a straight line","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perpendicular to the ray GM, and similarly the arc GF as a straight","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"line. But GM being the refraction of the ray RG, and FP being","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"perpendicular to it, QF must be to GP as 3 to 2, that is to say in the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,proportion of the refraction; as was shown above in explaining the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,discovery of Des Cartes. And the same thing occurs in all the small,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"arcs GH, HA, etc., namely that in the quadrilaterals which enclose","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,them the side parallel to the axis is to the opposite side as 3 to 2.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Then also as 3 to 2 will the sum of the one set be to the sum of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"other; that is to say, TF to AS, and DE to AK, and BE to SK or DV,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,supposing V to be the intersection of the curve EK and the ray FO.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"But, making FB perpendicular to DE, the ratio of 3 to 2 is also that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,of BE to the semi-diameter of the spherical wave which emanated from,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the point F while the light outside the transparent body traversed the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,space BE. Then it appears that this wave will intersect the ray FM at,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the same point V where it is intersected at right angles by the curve,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"EK, and consequently that the wave will touch this curve. In the same","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,way it can be proved that the same will apply to all the other waves,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"above mentioned, originating at the points G, H, etc.; to wit, that","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,they will touch the curve EK at the moment when the piece D of the,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,wave ED shall have reached E.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Now to say what these waves become after the rays have begun to cross,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,one another: it is that from thence they fold back and are composed of,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"two contiguous parts, one being a curve formed as evolute of the curve","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ENC in one sense, and the other as evolute of the same curve in the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"opposite sense. Thus the wave KE, while advancing toward the meeting","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"place becomes _abc_, whereof the part _ab_ is made by the evolute","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"_b_C, a portion of the curve ENC, while the end C remains attached;","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,and the part _bc_ by the evolute of the portion _b_E while the end E,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"remains attached. Consequently the same wave becomes _def_, then","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"_ghk_, and finally CY, from whence it subsequently spreads without any","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"fold, but always along curved lines which are evolutes of the curve","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"ENC, increased by some straight line at the end C.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"There is even, in this curve, a part EN which is straight, N being the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,point where the perpendicular from the centre X of the sphere falls,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"upon the refraction of the ray DE, which I now suppose to touch the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,sphere. The folding of the waves of light begins from the point N up,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"to the end of the curve C, which point is formed by taking AC to CX in","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the proportion of the refraction, as here 3 to 2.","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,As many other points as may be desired in the curve NC are found by a,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Theorem which Mr. Barrow has demonstrated in section 12 of his,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"_Lectiones Opticae_, though for another purpose. And it is to be noted","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,that a straight line equal in length to this curve can be given. For,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"since it together with the line NE is equal to the line CK, which is","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"known, since DE is to AK in the proportion of the refraction, it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,appears that by deducting EN from CK the remainder will be equal to,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,the curve NC.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,Similarly the waves that are folded back in reflexion by a concave,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"spherical mirror can be found. Let ABC be the section, through the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"axis, of a hollow hemisphere, the centre of which is D, its axis being","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"DB, parallel to which I suppose the rays of light to come. All the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,reflexions of those rays which fall upon the quarter-circle AB will,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"touch a curved line AFE, of which line the end E is at the focus of","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the hemisphere, that is to say, at the point which divides the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,semi-diameter BD into two equal parts. The points through which this,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"curve ought to pass are found by taking, beyond A, some arc AO, and","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,making the arc OP double the length of it; then dividing the chord OP,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,at F in such wise that the part FP is three times the part FO; for,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,then F is one of the required points.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,[Illustration],"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,And as the parallel rays are merely perpendiculars to the waves which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"fall on the concave surface, which waves are parallel to AD, it will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"be found that as they come successively to encounter the surface AB,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,they form on reflexion folded waves composed of two curves which,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,originate from two opposite evolutions of the parts of the curve AFE.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"So, taking AD as an incident wave, when the part AG shall have met the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"surface AI, that is to say when the piece G shall have reached I, it","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"will be the curves HF, FI, generated as evolutes of the curves FA, FE,","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"both beginning at F, which together constitute the propagation of the","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"part AG. And a little afterwards, when the part AK has met the surface","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"AM, the piece K having come to M, then the curves LN, NM, will","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,together constitute the propagation of that part. And thus this folded,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,wave will continue to advance until the point N has reached the focus,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"E. The curve AFE can be seen in smoke, or in flying dust, when a","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,concave mirror is held opposite the sun. And it should be known that,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,it is none other than that curve which is described by the point E on,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"the circumference of the circle EB, when that circle is made to roll","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,within another whose semi-diameter is ED and whose centre is D. So,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,"that it is a kind of Cycloid, of which, however, the points can be","Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,found geometrically.,"Huygens, Christiaan"
14725,,"Huygens, Christiaan"

37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"I say therfore, that being the last Summer in company with certain","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"the propriety of Cold[4], and there was alledged for instance, the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"example of Ice: now I at that time said, that, in my judgment, the Ice","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"should be rather Water rarified than condensed[5], and my reason was,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"because Condensation begets diminution of Mass, and augmentation of","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,    [Sidenote: Figure operates not in the Natation of Sollids.],"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"It was answered me, tha{t} that proceeded not from the greater Levity,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"but from the Figure, large and flat, which not being able to penetrate","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the Resistance of the Water, is the cause that it submergeth not. I","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"replied, that any piece of Ice, of whatsoever Figure, swims upon the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Water, a manifest signe, that its being never so flat and broad, hath","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"not any part in its floating: and added, that it was a manifest proofe","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,hereof to see a piece of Ice of very broad Figure being thrust to the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"botome of the Water, suddenly return to flote atoppe, which had it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"been more grave, and had its swimming proceeded from its Forme, unable","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to penetrate the Resistance of the _Medium_, that would be altogether","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"impossible; I concluded therefore, that the Figure was in sort a Cause","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of the Natation or Submersion of Bodies, but the greater or lesse","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Gravity in respect of the Water: and therefore all Bodyes heavier than,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"it of what Figure soever they be, indifferently go to the bottome, and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the lighter, though of any figure, float indifferently on the top: and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"I suppose that those which hold otherwise, were induced to that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"beliefe, by seeing how that diversity of Formes or Figures, greatly","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"altereth the Velosity, and Tardity of Motion; so that Bodies of Figure","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"broad and thin, descend far more leasurely into the Water, than those","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of a more compacted Figure, though both made of the same Matter: by","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,which some might be induced to believe that the Dilatation of the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Figure might reduce it to such amplenesse that it should not only,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"retard but wholly impede and take away the Motion, which I hold to be","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"false. Upon this Conclusion, in many dayes discourse, was spoken much,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"and many things, and divers Experiments produced, of which your","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Highnesse heard, and saw some, and in this discourse shall have all","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"suggested to my thoughts on this matter, and for confirmation of my","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Conclusion: which if it shall suffice to remove that (as I esteem,"Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"will do by considering the respective operation of the said Solids,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,and of Water: Which operation followes the Submersion and sinking; and,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"this it is[6], That in the Submersion that the Solid maketh, being","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"depressed downwards by its proper Gravity, it comes to drive away the","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"repulsed riseth and ascends above its first levell, to which Ascent on","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the other side it, as being a grave Body of its own nature, resists:","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"And because the descending Solid more and more immerging, greater and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"greater quantity of Water ascends, till the whole Sollid be submerged;","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,its necessary to compare the Moments of the Resistance of the water to,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Ascension, with the Moments of the pressive Gravity of the Solid: And","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"if the Moments of the Resistance of the water, shall equalize the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Moments of the Solid, before its totall Immersion[7]; in this case","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"doubtless there shall be made an _Equilibrium_, nor shall the Body","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"sink any farther. But if the Moment of the Solid, shall alwayes exceed","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the Moments wherewith the repulsed water successively makes,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Resistance[8], that Solid shall not only wholly submerge under water, but","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"shall descend to the Bottom. But if, lastly, in the instant of totall","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Submersion, the equality shall be made between the Moments of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"prement Solid, and the resisting Water[9]; then shall rest, ensue, and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the said Solid shall be able to rest indifferently, in whatsoever part","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,of the water. By this time is manifest the necessity of comparing the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Gravity of the water, and of the Solid[10]; and this comparison might at","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,first sight seem sufficient to conclude and determine which are the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Solids that float a-top, and which those that sink to the Bottom in","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the water, asserting that those shall float which are lesse grave _in","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"specie_ than the water, and those submerge, which are _in specie_ more","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"grave. For it seems in appearance, that the Sollid in sinking","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"continually, raiseth so much Water in Mass, as answers to the parts of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"its own Bulk submerged: whereupon it is impossible, that a Solid less","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"grave _in specie_, than water, should wholly sink, as being unable to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"raise a weight greater than its own, and such would a Mass of water","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"equall to its own Mass be. And likewise it seems necessary, that the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"graver Solids do go to the Bottom, as being of a Force more than","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"sufficient for the raising a Masse of water, equall to its own, though","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,inferiour in weight. Nevertheless the business succeeds otherwise: and,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"though the Conclusions are true, yet are the Causes thus assigned","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"deficient, nor is it true, that the Solid in submerging, raiseth and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"repulseth Masses of Water, equall to the parts of it self submerged;","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"but the Water repulsed, is alwayes less than the parts of the Solid","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,submerged[11]: and so much the more by how much the Vessell in which the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Water is contained is narrower: in such manner that it hinders not,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"but that a Solid may submerge all under Water, without raising so much","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Water in Mass, as would equall the tenth or twentieth part of its own","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Bulk: like as on the contrary, a very small quantity of Water, may","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"those censures, with which he appeareth to be charged. _Buonamico_","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"rejecteth the Doctrine of _Archimedes_, first[15], as not consentaneous","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"the contrary, that the Gravity of water, increaseth, by means of the","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"He farther addes[18], that _Aristotle_ had clearly confuted the Ancients,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"who said, that light Bodies moved upwards[19], driven by the impulse of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the more grave Ambient: which if it were so, it should seem of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"necessity to follow, that all naturall Bodies are by nature heavy, and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"none light: For that the same would befall the Fire and Air, if put in","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the Bottom of the water. And, howbeit, _Aristotle_ grants a Pulsion in","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the Elements, by which the Earth is reduced into a Sphericall Figure,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"yet nevertheless, in his judgement; it is not such that it can remove","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"grave Bodies from their naturall places, but rather, that it send them","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"toward the Centre, to which (as he somewhat obscurely continues to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"say,) the water principally moves, if it in the interim meet not with","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"something that resists it, and, by its Gravity, thrusts it out of its","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"place: in which case, if it cannot directly, yet at least as well as","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"it can, it tends to the Centre: but it happens, that light Bodies by","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"such Impulsion, do all ascend upward: but this properly they have by","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,which he would referre to the facile and difficult Separation of the,"Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"if the Doctrine be false, which depends upon them; but is contented to","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"Doctrine and Opinion of _Aristotle_. In answer to which Objections, I","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"say, first[21], That the being of _Archimedes_ Doctrine, simply different","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"from the Doctrine of _Aristotle_, ought not to move any to suspect it,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"there being no cause, why the Authority of this should be preferred to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the Authority of the other: but, because, where the decrees of Nature","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"are indifferently exposed to the intellectuall eyes of each, the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Authority of the one and the other, loseth all a{u}thenticalness of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Perswasion, the absolute power residing in Reason; therefore I pass to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that which he alledgeth in the second place[22], as an absurd consequent","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of the Doctrine of _Archimedes_, namely, That water should be more","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"grave than Earth. But I really find not, that ever _Archimedes_ said","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"such a thing, or that it can be rationally deduced from his","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Conclusions: and if that were manifest unto me, I verily believe, I","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"should renounce his Doctrine, as most erroneous. Perhaps this","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Deduction of _Buonamico_, is founded upon that which he citeth of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Vessel, which swims as long as its voyd of water, but once full it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"sinks to the Bottom, and understanding it of a Vessel of Earth, he","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,infers against _Archimedes_ thus: Thou sayst that the Solids which,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"swim, are less grave than water: this Vessell swimmeth: therefore,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,this Vessell is lesse grave than water. If this be the Illation. I,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"easily answer, granting that this Vessell is lesse grave than water,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"and denying the other consequence, namely, that Earth is less Grave","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"than Water. The Vessel that swims occupieth in the water, not only a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"place equall to the Mass of the Earth, of which it is formed; but","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"equall to the Earth and to the Air together, contained in its","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"concavity. And, if such a Mass compounded of Earth and Air, shall be","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"less grave than such another quantity of water, it shall swim, and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"shall accord with the Doctrine of _Archimedes_; but if, again,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"removing the Air, the Vessell shall be filled with water, so that the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Solid put in the water, be nothing but Earth, nor occupieth other","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"place, than that which is only possest by Earth, it shall then go to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the Bottom, by reason that the Earth is heavier than the water: and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,this corresponds well with the meaning of _Archimedes_. See the same,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"effect illustrated, with such another Experiment, In pressing a Viall","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Glass to the Bottom of the water, when it is full of Air, it will meet","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"with great resistance, because it is not the Glass alone, that is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"pressed under water, but together with the Glass a great Mass of Air,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"and such, that if you should take as much water, as the Mass of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Glass, and of the Air contained in it, you would have a weight much","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"greater than that of the Viall, and of its Air: and, therefore, it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,will not submerge without great violence: but if we demit only the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Glass into the water, which shall be when you shall fill the Glass","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"The third difficulty in the doctrine of _Archimedes_ was, that he","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"could not render a reason whence it arose, that a piece of Wood, and a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Vessell of Wood, which otherwise floats, goeth to the bottom, if","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,filled with Water. _Signor Buonamico_ hath supposed that a Vessell of,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Wood, and of Wood that by nature swims, as before is said, goes to the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"bottom, if it be filled with water; of which he in the following","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Chapter, which is the 30 of the fifth Book copiously discourseth: but","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,I (speaking alwayes without diminution of his singular Learning) dare,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in defence of _Archimedes_ deny this experiment, being certain that a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"piece of Wood which by its nature sinks not in Water, shall not sinke","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,though it be turned and converted into the forme of any Vessell,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"whatsoever, and then filled with Water: and he that would readily see","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the Experiment in some other tractable Matter, and that is easily","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"reduced into several Figures, may take pure Wax, and making it first","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"into a Ball or other solid Figure, let him adde to it so much Lead as","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"shall just carry it to the bottome, so that being a graine less it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"could not be able to sinke it, and making it afterwards into the forme","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of a Dish, and filling it with Water, he shall finde that without the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"said Lead it shall not sinke, and that with the Lead it shall descend","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"with much slowness: & in short he shall satisfie himself, that the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Water included makes no alteration. I say not all this while, but that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"its possible of Wood to make Barkes, which being filled with water,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"sinke; but that proceeds not through its Gravity, encreased by the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Water, but rather from the Nailes and other Iron Workes, so that it no","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"longer hath a Body less grave than Water, but one mixt of Iron and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Wood, more grave than a like Masse of Water. Therefore let _Signor","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Buonamico_ desist from desiring a reason of an effect, that is not in","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,nature: yea if the sinking of the Woodden Vessell when its full of,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Water, may call in question the Doctrine of _Archimedes_, which he","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"would not have you to follow, is on the contrary consonant and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"agreeable to the Doctrine of the Peripateticks, since it aptly","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"assignes a reason why such a Vessell must, when its full of Water,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"descend to the bottom; converting the Argument the other way, we may","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"with safety say that the Doctrine of _Archimedes_ is true, since it","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"understands the same not only of a piece of wood, shaped in the forme","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of a Vessell, but also of massie Wood, which filled, _scilicet_, as I","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"believe, he would say, soaked and steeped in Water, goes finally to","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"Porosity is replenished with Air, or other Matter less grave than","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Water, are Masses specificially less grave than the said Water, like","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"consists in the Matter of the Glass, and not in the Water, which","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"As to that finally which presents itself in the fourth place,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"namely, that the _Ancients_ have been heretofore confuted by","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_Aristotle_, who denying Positive and Absolute Levity, and truely","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"esteeming all Bodies to be grave, said, that that which moved upward","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"was driven by the circumambient Air, and therefore that also the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Doctrine of _Archimedes_, as an adherent to such an Opinion was","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"convicted and confuted: I answer first, that _Signor Buonamico_ in my","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"judgement hath imposed upon _Archimedes_, and deduced from his words","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"more than ever he intended by them, or may from his Propositions be","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"collected, in regard that _Archimedes_ neither denies, nor admitteth","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Positive Levity, nor doth he so much as mention it: so that much less","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"ought _Buonamico_ to inferre, that he hath denyed that it might be the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Cause and Principle of the Ascension of Fire, and other Light Bodies[23]:","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"having but only demonstrated, that Solid Bodies more grave than Water","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"descend in it, according to the excess of their Gravity above the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Gravity of that, he demonstrates likewise, how the less grave ascend","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in the same Water[24], accordng to its excess of Gravity, above the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Gravity of them. So that the most that can be gathered from the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Demonstration of _Archimedes_ is, that like as the excess of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Gravity of the Moveable above the Gravity of the Water, is the Cause","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that it descends therein, so the excess of the Gravity of the water","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"above that of the Moveable, is a sufficient Cause why it descends not,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,but rather betakes it self to swim: not enquiring whether of moving,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"upwards there is, or is not any other Cause contrary to Gravity: nor","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,doth _Archimedes_ discourse less properly than if one should say: If,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the South Winde shall assault the Barke with greater _Impetus_ than is,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the violence with which the Streame of the River carries it towards,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the South, the motion of it shall be towards the North: but if the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_Impetus_ of the Water shall overcome that of the Winde, its motion","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,shall be towards the South. The discourse is excellent and would be,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"unworthily contradicted by such as should oppose it, saying: Thou","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"mis-alledgest as Cause of the motion of the Bark towards the South,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the _Impetus_ of the Stream of the Water above that of the South,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Winde; mis-alledgest I say, for it is the Force of the North Winde","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"opposite to the South, that is able to drive the Bark towards the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"South. Such an Objection would be superfluous, because he which","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"alledgeth for Cause of the Motion the Stream of the Water, denies not","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"but that the Winde opposite to the South may do the same, but only","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"affirmeth that the force of the Water prevailing over the South Wind,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the Bark shall move towards the South: and saith no more than is true.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"And just thus when _Archimedes_ saith, that the Gravity of the Water","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"prevailing over that by which the moveable descends to the Bottom,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,such moveable shall be raised from the Bottom to the Surface alledgeth,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"a very true Cause of such an Accident, nor doth he affirm or deny that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"there is, or is not, a vertue contrary to Gravity, called by some","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Levity, that hath also a power of moving some Matters upwards. Let","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,therefore the Weapons of _Signor Buonamico_ be directed against,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_Plato_[25], and other _Ancients_, who totally denying _Levity_, and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"taking all Bodies to be grave, say that the Motion upwards is made,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"not from an intrinsecal Principle of the Moveable, but only by the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Impulse of the _Medium_; and let _Archimedes_ and his Doctrine escape,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"him, since he hath given him no Cause of quarelling with him. But if","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"Reasons of _Aristotle_ on the contrary, I believe that I could be able","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"fully to answer them, and I would assay to do it, if it were","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"absolutely necessary to the present Matter, or were it not too long a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Digression for this short Treatise. I will only say, that if there","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"Naturall Inclination to shun the Centre of the Earth, and to move","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"shewing how the Ball in Water descended to the bottom, and the Board","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"and with the Authority of _Aristotle_, confirmed themselves in their","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Opinions, that the Cause of that Rest was the breadth of the Figure,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,u{n}able by its small weight to pierce and penetrate the Resistance of,"Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"worketh, its necessary to make the Experiment with Matter wherein","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"by takeing one only Matter, that is tractable and easily reduceable","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"into every sort of Figure. Moreover, it will be an excellent expedient","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to take a kinde of Matter, exactly alike in Gravity unto the Water:","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"for that Matter, as far as pertaines to the Gravity, is indifferent","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,either to Ascend or Descend; so that we may presently observe any the,"Galilei, Galileo"

37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Me thinkes I hear some of the Adversaries to raise a doubt upon my,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"produced Experiment[40]. And first that they offer to my consideration,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that the Figure, as a Figure simply, and disjunct from the Matter","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"workes not any effect, but requires to be conjoyned with the Matter;","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"and, furthermore, not with every Matter, but with those only,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,wherewith it may be able to execute the desired operation. Like as we,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"see it verified by Experience, that the Acute and sharp Angle is more","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"apt to cut, than the Obtuse; yet alwaies provided, that both the one","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"and the other, be joyned with a Matter apt to cut, as for example,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"with Steel. Therefore, a Knife with a fine and sharp edge, cuts Bread","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"or Wood with much ease, which it will not do, if the edge be blunt and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"thick: but he that will instead of Steel, take Wax, and mould it into","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"a Knife, undoubtedly shall never know the effects of sharp and blunt","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"edges: because neither of them will cut, the Wax being unable by","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"reason of its flexibility, to overcome the hardness of the Wood and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Bread. And, therefore, applying the like discourse to our purpose,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"they say, that the difference of Figure will shew different effects,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"touching Natation and Submersion, but not conjoyned with any kind of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Matter, but only with those Matters which, by their Gravity, are apt","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to resist the Velocity of the water, whence he that would elect for","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the Matter, Cork or other light wood, unable, through its Levity, to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"superate the Crassitude of the water, and of that Matter should forme","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Solids of divers Figures, would in vain seek to find out what","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"they have made choice of such a Matter, as fit, that being readily","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"reduced into Sphericall Figure, goes to the Bottom; and it is Ebony,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of which they afterwards making a small Board or Splinter, as thin as","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"a Lath, have illustrated how that this, put upon the Surface of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, rests there without descending to the Bottom: and making, on","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the otherside, of the same wood a Ball, no less than a hazell Nut,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"they shew, that this swims not, but descendes. From which Experiment,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"they think they may frankly conclude, that the Breadth of the Figure","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in the flat Lath or Board, is the cause of its not descending to the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Bottom, for as much as a Ball of the same Matter, not different from","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"if many perswaded by a certain cursory observation, should yield","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"credit to it; nevertheless, I think I am able to discover, how that it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,is not free from falacy.,"Galilei, Galileo"

37729,from the Corporeall substance[42]: nor have I ever alledged them stript of,"Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"to examine the Diversity of Accidents, dependant upon the variety of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Figures, it is necessary to apply them to Matters, which obstruct not","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the various operations of those various Figures: and I admit and,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"grant, that I should do very ill; if I would experiment the influence","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of Acutenesse of edge with a Knife of Wax, applying it to cut an Oak,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,because there is no Acuteness in Wax able to cut that very hard wood.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"But yet such an Experiment of this Knife, would not be besides the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"purpose, to cut curded Milk, or other very yielding Matter: yea, in","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"such like Matters, the Wax is more commodious than Steel; for finding","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the diversity depending upon Angles, more or less Acute, for that Milk","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"is indifferently cut with a Raisor, and with a Knife, that hath a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"blunt edge. It needs, therefore, that regard be had, not only to the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"hardness, solidity or Gravity of Bodies, which under divers figures,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"are to divide and penetrate some Matters, but it forceth also, that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"regard be had, on the other side, to the Resistance of the Matters, to","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,concerning our Contest; chosen a Matter which penetrates the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Resistance of the water; and in all figures descendes to the Bottome,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the Adversaries can charge me with no defect; yea, I have propounded","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"so much a more excellent Method than they, in as much as I have","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"Cutting, that like as Acuteness is inefficient to cut, unless when it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,is in a Matter hard and apt to superate the Resistance of the wood or,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"other Matter, which we intend to cut; so the aptitude of descending or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"not descending in water, ought and can only be known in those Matters,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that are able to overcome the Renitence, and superate the Crassitude","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of the water. Unto which, I say, that to make distinction and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"election, more of this than of that Matter, on which to impress the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Figures for cutting or penetrating this or that Body, as the solidity","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"or obdurateness of the said Bodies shall be greater or less, is very","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"necessary: but withall I subjoyn, that such distinction, election and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"caution would be superfluous and unprofitable, if the Body to be cut","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"or penetrated, should have no Resistance, or should not at all","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,withstand the Cutting or Penitration: and if the Knife were to be used,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in cutting a Mist or Smoak, one of Paper would be equally serviceable","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,with one of _Damascus_ Steel: and so by reason the water hath not any,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Resistance against the Penitration of any Solid Body, all choice of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Matter is superfluous and needless, and the Election which I said","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,above to have been well made of a Matter reciprocall in Gravity to,"Galilei, Galileo"

37729,the sinking of Solid Bodies: and for what concerneth the Resistance of,"Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"the fundamentall and principall point in this Case, that the Air","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"contained in this Vessel before the infusion of the Water, was that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"which kept it a-float[49], since that there was made of it, and of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Brass, a Composition less grave than an equall quantity of Water: and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the place that the Vessel occupyeth in the Water whilst it floats, is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"not equall to the Brass alone, but to the Brass and to the Air","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"together, which filleth that part of the Vessel that is below the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Levell of the water: Moreover, when the Water is infused, the Air is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"removed, and there is a composition made of Brass and of water, more","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"grave _in specie_ than the simple water, but not by vertue of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water infused, as having greater Specifick Gravity than the other","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, but through the proper Gravity of the Brass, and through the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"alienation of the Air. Now, as he that should say that Brass, that by","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"its nature goes to the Bottom, being formed into the Figure of a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Ketle[50], acquireth from that Figure a vertue of lying in the Water","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"without sinking, would say that which is false; because that Brass","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"fashioned into any whatever Figure, goeth always to the Bottom,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"provided, that that which is put into the water be simple Brass; and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"it is not the Figure of the Vessel that makes the Brass to float, but","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,it is because that that is not purely Brass which is put into the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, but an aggregate of Brass and of Air: so is it neither more nor","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"less false, that a thin Plate of Brass or of Ebony, swims by vertue of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"its dilated & broad Figure: for the truth is, that it bares up without","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"submerging, because that that which is put in the water, is not pure","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Brass or simple Ebony, but an aggregate of Brass and Air, or of Ebony","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"and Air. And, this is not contrary unto my Conclusion, the which,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"(having many a time seen Vessels of Mettall, and thin pieces of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"diverse grave Matters float, by vertue of the Air conjoyned with them)","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"did affirm, That Figure was not the Cause of the Natation or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Submersion of such Solids as were placed in the water. Nay more, I","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"cannot omit, but must tell my Antagonists, that this new conceit of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"denying that the Superficies of the Board should be bathed, may beget","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,in a third person an opinion of a poverty of Arguments of defence on,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"their part, since that such bathing was never insisted upon by them in","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the beginning of our Dispute, and was not questioned in the least,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,being that the Originall of the discourse arose upon the swiming of,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Flakes of Ice, wherein it would be simplicity to require that their","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Superficies might bedry: besides, that whether these pieces of Ice be","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"that I affirm, that the contiguous superiour Air is able to sustain","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that Plate of Brass or of Silver, that stayeth above water; as if I","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"would in a certain sence allow the Air[51], a kind of Magnetick vertue of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"sustaining the grave Bodies, with which it is contiguous. To satisfie","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"all I may, to all doubts, I have been considering how by some other","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"sensible Experiment I might demonstrate, how truly that little","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"contiguous and superiour Air sustaines those Solids, which being by","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"nature apt to descend to the Bottom, being placed lightly on the water","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"submerge not, unless they be first thorowly bathed; and have found,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that one of these Bodies having descended to the Bottom, by","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"conveighing to it (without touching it in the least) a little Air,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"which conjoyneth with the top of the same, it becometh sufficient, not","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"only, as before to sustain it, but also to raise it, and to carry it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"back to the top, where it stays and abideth in the same manner, till","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"such time, as the assistance of the conjoyned Air is taken away. And","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to this effect, I have taken a Ball of Wax, and made it with a little","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Lead, so grave, that it leasurely descends to the Bottom, making with","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,all its Superficies very smooth and pollite: and this being put gently,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"into the water, almost wholly submergeth, there remaining vissible","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"only a little of the very top[52], the which so long as it is conjoyned","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"with the Air, shall retain the Ball a-top, but the Contiguity of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Air taken away by wetting it, it shall descend to the Bottom and there","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"remain. Now to make it by vertue of the Air, that before sustained it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to return again to the top, and stay there, thrust into the water a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Glass reversed with the mouth downwards, the which shall carry with it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the Air it contains, and move this towards the Ball, abasing it till","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"such time that you see, by the transparency of the Glass, that the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,contained Air do arrive to the summity of the _B_all[53]: then gently,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"withdraw the Glass upwards, and you shall see the _B_all to rise, and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"afterwards stay on the top of the water[54], if you carefully part the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Glass and the water without overmuch commoving and disturbing it.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"There is, therefore, a certain affinity between the Air and other","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Bodies, which holds them unied, so, that they seperate not without a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,kind of violence. The same likewise is seen in the water[55]; for if we,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"shall wholly submerge some Body in it, so that it be thorowly bathed,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in the drawing of it afterwards gently out again, we shall see the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water follow it, and rise notably above its Surface, before it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"seperates from it. Solid Bodies, also[56], if they be equall and alike in","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Superficies, so, that they make an exact Contact without the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"interposition of the least Air, that may part them in the seperation","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,and yield untill that the ambient _Medium_ succeeds to replenish the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"place, do hold very firmly conjoyned, and are not to be seperated","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"without great force but, because, the Air, Water, and other Liquids,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,very expeditiously shape themselves to contact with any Solid,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_B_odies, so that their Superficies do exquisitely adopt themselves to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that of the Solids, without any thing remaining between them,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"therefore, the effect of this Conjunction and Adherence is more","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"manifestly and frequently observed in them, than in hard and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"inflexible Bodies, whose Superficies do very rarely conjoyn with","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"themselves, by which they resist and oppose Division, Distraction, and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Seperation, because there is no such Coherence and Resistance of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Division for if there were, it would be no less in the internall parts","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"than in those nearer the superiour or externall Surface, so that the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"same Board, finding alwayes the same Resistance and Renitence, would","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"no less stop in the middle of the water than about the Surface, which","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"is false. Moreover, what Resistance can we place in the Continuity of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the water, if we see that it is impossible to find any Body of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"whatsoever Matter, Figure or Magnitude, which being put into the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, shall be obstructed and impeded by the Tenacity of the parts of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the water to one another, so, but that it is moved upwards or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"downwards, according as the Cause of their Motion transports it? And,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"what greater proof of it can we desier, than that which we daily see","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in Muddy waters, which being put into Vessels to be drunk, and being,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"after some hours setling[58], still, as we say, thick in the end, after","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"four or six dayes they are wholly setled, and become pure and clear?","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Nor can their Resistance of Penetration stay those impalpable and,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"insensible Atomes of Sand, which by reason of their exceeding small","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"force, spend six dayes in descending the space of half a yard.","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"    [58] The settlement of _M_uddy Water, proveth that that Element","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,    hath no aversion to Division.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  _Nor let them say, that the seeing of such small Bodies, consume","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  six dayes in descending so little a way, is a sufficient Argument","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  of the Waters Resistance of Division; because that is no resisting,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  of Division, but a retarding of Motion; and it would be simplicity","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  to say, that a thing opposeth Division[59], and that in the same","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  instant, it permits it self to be divided: nor doth the Retardation","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,    self to be divided.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"What then is this Crassitude of the water, with which it resisteth","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Division? What, I beseech you, should it be, if we (as we have said","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,above) with all diligence attempting the reduction of a Matter into so,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"like a Gravity with the water, that forming it into a dilated Plate it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"rests suspended as we have said, between the two waters, it be","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"impossible to effect it, though we bring them to such an","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Equiponderance, that as much Lead as the fourth part of a Grain of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Musterd-seed, added to the same expanded Plate, that in Air [_i. e.","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"out of the water_] shall weigh four or six pounds, sinketh it to the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Bottom, and being substracted, it ascends to the Surface of the water?","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"I cannot see, (if what I say be true, as it is most certain) what","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"minute vertue and force we can possibly find or imagine, to which the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Resistance of the water against Division and Penetration is not,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"inferiour; whereupon, we must of necessity conclude that it is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"nothing: because, if it were of any sensible power, some large Plate","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,might be found or compounded of a Matter alike in Gravity to the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, which not only would stay between the two waters; but,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"moreover, should not be able to descend or ascend without notable","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"force. We may likewise collect the same from an other Experiment[60],","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,shewing that the Water gives way also in the same manner to,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,transversall Division; for if in a setled and standing water we should,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"place any great Mass that goeth not to the bottom, drawing it with a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"single Womans Hair, we might carry it from place to place without any","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"opposition, and this whatever Figure it hath, though that it possess a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"great space of water, as for instance, a great Beam would do moved","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"side-ways. Perhaps some might oppose me and say, that if the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Resistance of water against Division, as I affirm, were nothing; Ships","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,should not need such a force of Oars and Sayles for the moving of them,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"from place to place in a tranquile Sea, or standing Lake. To him that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"should make such an objection, I would reply[61], that the water","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"contrasteth not against, nor simply resisteth Division, but a sudden","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Division, and with so much greater Renitence, by how much greater the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Velocity is: and the Cause of this Resistance depends not on,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Crassitude, or any other thing that absolutely opposeth Division, but","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"because that the parts of the water divided, in giving way to that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Solid that is moved in it, are themselves also necessitated locally to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"move, some to the one side, and some to the other, and some downwards:","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"and this must no less be done by the waves before the Ship, or other","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Body swimming through the water, than by the posteriour and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"subsequent; because, the Ship proceeding forwards, to make it self a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"way to receive its Bulk, it is requisite, that with the Prow it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"repulse the adjacent parts of the water, as well on one hand as on the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"other, and that it move them as much transversly, as is the half of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the breadth of the Hull: and the like removall must those waves make,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,that succeeding the Poump do run from the remoter parts of the Ship,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"towards those of the middle, successively to replenish the places,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"which the Ship in advancing forwards, goeth, leaving vacant. Now,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"because, all Motitions are made in Time[62], and the longer in greater","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"time: and it being moreover true, that those Bodies that in a certain","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"time are moved by a certain power such a certain space, shall not be","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"moved the same space, and in a shorter Time, unless by a greater","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Power: therefore, the broader Ships move slower than the narrower,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,being put on by an equall Force: and the same Vessel requires so much,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"greater force of Wind, or Oars, the faster it is to move.","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,    [60] An hair will draw a great Mass thorow the Water; which,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"    proveth, that it hath no Resistance against transversall","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,    Division.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,    [61] How ships are moved in the water.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"    [62] Bodies moved a certain space in a certain Time, by a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"    certain power, cannot be moved the same space and in a shorter","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"    time, but by a greater power.","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  _But yet for all this, any great Mass swimming in a standing Lake,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  may be moved by any petit force; only it is true, that a lesser","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  force more slowly moves it: but if the waters Resistance of,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Division, were in any manner sensible, it would follow, that the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  said Mass, should, notwithstanding the percussion of some sensible","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  force, continue immoveable, which is not so[63]. Yea, I will say","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  farther, that should we retire our selves into the more internall","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  contemplation of the Nature of water and other Fluids, perhaps we","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  should discover the Constitution of their parts to be such, that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  they not only do not oppose Division, but that they have not any","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  thing in them to be divided: so that the Resistance that is,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  observed in moving through the water[64], is like to that which we meet","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  with in passing through a great Throng of People, wherein we find","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  impediment, and not by any difficulty in the Division, for that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  none of those persons are divided whereof the Croud is composed,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  but only in moving of those persons side-ways which were before,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  divided and disjoyned: and thus we find Resistance in thrusting a,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Stick into an heap of Sand, not because any part of the Sand is to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  be cut in pieces, but only to be moved and raised[65]. Two manners of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Penetration, therefore, offer themselves to us, one in Bodies,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  whose parts were continuall, and here Division seemeth necessary,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  the other in the aggregates of parts not continuall, but contiguous","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  only[66], and here there is no necessity of dividing but of moving","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  only. Now, I am not well resolved, whether water and other Fluids","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  may be esteemed to be of parts continuall or contiguous only[67]; yet I,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  find my self indeed inclined to think that they are rather,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  contiguous (if there be in Nature no other manner of aggregating,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  than by the union, or by the touching of the extreams:) and I am","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  induced thereto by the great difference that I see between the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Conjunction of the parts of an hard or Solid Body[68], and the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  Conjunction of the same parts when the same Body shall be made,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Liquid and Fluid: for if, for example, I take a Mass of Silver or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  other Solid and hard Mettall, I shall in dividing it into two","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  parts, find not only the resistance that is found in the moving of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  it only[69], but an other incomparably greater, dependent on that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  vertue, whatever it be, which holds the parts united: and so if we","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  would divide again those two parts into other two, and successively","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  into others and others, we should still find a like Resistance, but","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  ever less by how much smaller the parts to be divided shall be; but,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  if, lastly, employing most subtile and acute Instruments, such as","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  are the most tenuous parts of the Fire, we shall resolve it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  (perhaps) into its last and least Particles, there shall not be","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  left in them any longer either Resistance of Division, or so much","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  as a capacity of being farther divided, especially by Instruments","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  more grosse than the acuities of Fire: and what Knife or Rasor put,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  into well melted Silver can we finde, that will divide a thing","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  which surpasseth the separating power of Fire? Certainly none:,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  because either the whole shall be reduced to the most minute and,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  ultimate Divisions, or if there remain parts capable still of other","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Subdidivisions, they cannot receive them, but only from acuter","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Divisors than Fire; but a Stick or Rod of Iron, moved in the melted","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Metall, is not such a one. Of a like Constitution and Consistence,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  I account the parts of Water[70], and other Liquids to be, namely,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  incapable of Division by reason of their Ienuity; or if not,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  absolutely indivisible, yet at least not to be divided by a Board,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  or other Solid Body, palpable unto the hand, the Sector being","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  alwayes required to be more sharp than the Solid to be cut. Solid,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Bodies, therefore, do only move, and not divide the Water[71], when put","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  into it; whose parts being before divided to the extreamest,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  minuity, and therefore capable of being moved, either many of them","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  at once, or few, or very few, they soon give place to every small","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Corpuscle, that descends in the same: for that, it being little and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  light, descending in the Air, and arriving to the Surface of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Water, it meets with Particles of Water more small, and of less","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Resistance against Motion and Extrusion, than is its own prement","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  and extrusive force; whereupon it submergeth, and moveth such a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  portion of them, as is proportionate to its Power. There is not,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  therefore, any Resistance in Water against Division, nay, there is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  not in it any divisible parts. I adde; moreover, that in case yet","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  there should be any small Resistance found (which is absolutely,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  false)[72] haply in attempting with an Hair to move a very great natant,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Machine, or in essaying by the addition of one small Grain of Lead","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  to sink, or by removall of it to raise a very broad Plate of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Matter, equall in Gravity with Water, (which likewise will not","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  happen, in case we proceed with dexterity) we may observe that that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  Resistance is a very different thing from that which the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  Adversaries produce for the Cause of the Natation of the Plate of,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Lead or Board of Ebony, for that one may make a Board of Ebony,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  which being put upon the Water swimmeth, and cannot be submerged,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  no not by the addition of an hundred Grains of Lead put upon the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  same, and afterwards being bathed, not only sinks, though the said","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Lead be taken away, but though moreover a quantity of Cork, or of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  some other light Body fastened to it, sufficeth not to hinder it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  from sinking unto the bottome: so that you see, that although it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  were granted that there is a certain small Resistance of Division,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  found in the substance of the Water, yet this hath nothing to do","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  with that Cause which supports the Board above the Water, with a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  Resistance an hundred times greater than that which men can find in,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  the parts of the Water: nor let them tell me, that only the Surface","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  of the Water hath such Resistance[73], and not the internall parts, or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  that such Resistance is found greatest in the beginning of the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Submersion, as it also seems that in the beginning, Motion meets","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  with greater opposition, than in the continuance of it; because,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  first, I will permit, that the Water be stirred, and that the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  superiour parts be mingled with the middle[74], and inferiour parts, or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  that those above be wholly removed, and those in the middle only","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  made use off, and yet you shall see the effect for all that, to be","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  still the same: Moreover, that Hair which draws a Beam through the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Water, is likewise to divide the upperparts, and is also to begin","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  the Motion, and yet it begins it, and yet it divides it: and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  finally, let the Board of Ebony be put in the midway, betwixt the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  bottome and the top of the Water, and let it there for awhile be","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  suspended and setled, and afterwards let it be left at liberty, and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  it will instantly begin its Motion, and will continue it unto the","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"more grave than the Water, to stay in the Confines of the Water and","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"breadth of the Figure, unable to overcome the Renitence with which the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Water opposeth Division, since there is no Resistance; and from that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"which is not in being, we can expect no Action. It remains most true,","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,let its thickness I O be equall to the greatest Altitude of the Banks,"Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"submerge: for the Altitude A I being equall to the Altitude I O, the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Mass of the Air A B C I shall be equall to the Mass of the Solid C I O,"Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"shall the Gravity of a Mass of water equall to the Mass I S, be to the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Gravity of the Solid I S: But as I O is to O A, so is a Mass of water","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,The truth of this Proposition is sufficiently manifest in all those,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Solid Figures, that determine in their uppermost part in a plane","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Superficies: for making such Figures of some Matter specifically as,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"grave as the water, putting them into the water, so that the whole","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"provided, that such a Matter equall in weight to the water, may be","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"exactly adjusted: and they shall by consequence, rest or lie even with","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the Levell of the water, without making any Rampart. If, therefore, in","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"respect of the Matter, such Figures are apt to rest without","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"submerging, though deprived of the help of the Rampart, it is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"manifest, that they may admit so much encrease of Gravity, (without","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,encreasing their Masses) as is the weight of as much water as would be,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"contained within the Rampart, that is made about their upper plane","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"cleerly comprehend, that the Rampart added or removed, may prohibit or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,permit the descent: but in those Figures that go lessening upwards,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"towards the top, some Persons may, and that not without much seeming","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Reason, doubt whether the same may be done, and especially by those","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"which terminate in a very acute Point, such as are your Cones and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"small Piramids. Touching these, therefore, as more dubious than the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"rest, I will endeavour to demonstrate, that they also lie under the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"same Accident of going, or not going to the Bottom, be they of any","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"whatever bigness. Let therefore the Cone be A B D, made of a matter","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,specifically as grave as the water; it is manifest that being put all,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"under water, it shall rest in all places (alwayes provided, that it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"shall weigh exactly as much as the water, which is almost impossible","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to effect) and that any small weight being added to it, it shall sink","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to the bottom: but if it shall descend downwards gently, I say, that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"it shall make the Rampart E S T O, and that there shall stay out of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the water the point A S T, tripple in height to the Rampart E S: which","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"is manifest, for the Matter of the Cone weighing equally with the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, the part submerged _S B D T_, becomes indifferent to move","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"downwards or upwards; and the Cone _A S T_, being equall in Mass to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the water that would be contained in the concave of the Rampart _E S T,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"O_, shall be also equall unto it in Gravity: and, therefore, there","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"shall be a perfect _Equilibrium_, and, consequently, a Rest. Now here","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"ariseth a doubt, whether the Cone _A B D_ may be made heavier, in such","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"sort, that when it is put wholly under water, it goes to the bottom,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"but yet not in such sort, as to take from the Rampart the vertue of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"sustaining it that it sink not, and, the reason of the doubt is this:","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,that although at such time as the Cone _A B D_ is specifically as,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"grave as the water, the Rampart _E S T O_ sustaines it, not only when","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the point _A S T_ is tripple in height to the Altitude of the Rampart,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_E S_, but also when a lesser part is above water; [for although in","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the Descent of the Cone the Point _A S T_ by little and little,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"diminisheth, and so likewise the Rampart _E S T O_, yet the Point","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"diminisheth in greater proportion than the Rampart, in that it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"diminisheth according to all the three Dimensions, but the Rampart","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"according to two only, the Altitude still remaining the same; or, if","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"you will, because the Cone _S {A} T_ goes diminishing, according to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the proportion of the cubes of the Lines that do successively become,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the Diameters of the Bases of emergent Cones, and the Ramparts","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,diminish according to the proportion of the Squares of the same Lines;,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,whereupon the proportions of the Points are alwayes Sesquialter of the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"proportions of the Cylinders, contained within the Rampart; so that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"if, for Example, the height of the emergent Point were double, or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"equall to the height of the Rampart, in these cases, the Cylinder","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"contained within the Rampart, would be much greater than the said","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Point, because it would be either sesquialter or tripple, by reason of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"which it would perhaps serve over and above to sustain the whole Cone,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"since the part submerged would no longer weigh any thing;] yet,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"nevertheless, when any Gravity is added to the whole Mass of the Cone,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,so that also the part submerged is not without some excesse of Gravity,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"above the Gravity of the water, it is not manifest, whether the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Cylinder contained within the Rampart, in the descent that the Cone","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"shall make, can be reduced to such a proportion unto the emergent","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Point, and to such an excesse of Mass above the Mass of it, as to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,compensate the excesse of the Cones Specificall Gravity above the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Gravity of the water: and the Scruple ariseth, because that howbeit in","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the descent made by the Cone, the emergent Point _A S T_ diminisheth,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,whereby there is also a diminution of the excess of the Cones Gravity,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"above the Gravity of the water, yet the case stands so, that the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Rampart doth also contract it self, and the Cylinder contained in it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"doth deminish. Nevertheless it shall be demonstrated, how that the","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"Therefore, the Cylinder _C I R N_, shall be double to the Cone _A I","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"R_: and the water which might be contained in the Rampart _C I R N_,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"would be double in Mass and in Weight to the Cone _A I R_, and,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"therefore, would be able to sustain the double of the Weight of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Cone _A I R_: Therefore, if to the whole Cone _A B D_, there be added","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"as much Weight as the Gravity of the Cone _A I R_, that is to say, the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"eighth part of the weight of the Cone _A S T_, it also shall be","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"sustained by the Rampart _C I R N_, but without that it shall go to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the bottome: the Cone _A B D_, being, by the addition of the eighth","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"part of the weight of the Cone _A S T_, made specifically more grave","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"than the water. But if the Altitude of the Cone _A I R_, were two","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"thirds of the Altitude of the Cone _A S T_, the Cone _A S T_ would be","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to the Cone _A I R_, as twenty seven to eight; and the Cylinder _E S T","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"above the Cone _A I R_, to the Cone _A S T_, as four to twenty seven:","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"same with, the true, Naturall and primary cause of Natation or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Submersion; to wit, the excess or deficiency of the Gravity of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, in relation to the Gravity of that Solid Magnitude, that is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"demitted into the water. For like as a Plate of Lead, as thick as the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"back of a Knife, which being put into the water by it self alone goes","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to the bottom, if upon it you fasten a piece of Cork four fingers","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"thick, doth continue afloat, for that now the Solid that is demitted","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in the water, is not, as before, more grave than the water, but less,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"so the Board of Ebony, of its own nature more grave than water; and,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"therefore, descending to the bottom, when it is demitted by it self","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"alone into the water, if it shall be put upon the water, conjoyned","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"with an Expanded vail of Air, that together with the Ebony doth","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"descend, and that it be such, as that it doth make with it a compound","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"less grave than so much water in Mass, as equalleth the Mass already","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"submerged and depressed beneath the Levell of the waters Surface, it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"shall not descend any farther, but shall rest, for no other than the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"universall and most common cause, which is that Solid Magnitudes, less","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"grave _in specie_ than the water, go not to the bottom.","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"So that if one should take a Plate of Lead, as for Example, a finger","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"thick, and an handfull broad every way, and should attempt to make it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"swimme, with putting it lightly on the water, he would lose his","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Labour, because that if it should be depressed an Hairs breadth beyond","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the possible Altitude of the Ramparts of water, it would dive and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"sink; but if whilst it is going downwards, one should make certain","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Banks or Ramparts about it, that should hinder the defusion of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water upon the said Plate, the which Banks should rise so high, as","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that they might be able to contain as much water, as should weigh","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"equally with the said Plate, it would, witho{u}t all Question, descend","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"no lower, but would rest, as being sustained by vertue of the Air","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"contained within the aforesaid Ramparts: and, in short, there would be","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,a Vessell by this means formed with the bottom of Lead. But if the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"thinness of the Lead shall be such, that a very small height of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Rampart would suffice to contain so much Air, as might keep it afloat,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"it shall also rest without the Artificiall Banks or Ramparts, but yet","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"not without the Air, because the Air by it self makes Banks sufficient","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"for a small height, to resist the Superfusion of the water: so that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that which in this case swimmes, is as it were a Vessell filled with","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Air, by vertue of which it continueth afloat.","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"I will, in the last place, with an other Experime{n}t, attempt to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"remove all difficulties, if so be there should yet be any doubt left","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in any one, touching the opperation of this [E]Continuity of the Air,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"with the thin Plate which swims, and afterwards put an end to this","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,part of my discourse.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"    [E] Or rather Contiguity,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,I suppose my self to be questioning with some of my Oponents.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Whether Figure have any influence upon the encrease or diminution of,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the Resistance in any Weight against its being raised in the Air[78]; and,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"I suppose, that I am to maintain the Affirmative, asserting that a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Mass of Lead, reduced to the Figure of a Ball, shall be raised with","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"less force, then if the same had been made into a thinne and broad","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Plate, because that it in this spacious Figure, hath a great quantity","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of Air to penetrate, and in that other, more compacted and contracted","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"very little: and to demonstrate the truth of such my Opinion, I will","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"hang in a small thred first the Ball or Bullet, and put that into the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, tying the thred that upholds it to one end of the Ballance that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"I hold in the Air, and to the other end I by degrees adde so much","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Weight, till that at last it brings up the Ball of Lead out of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water: to do which, suppose a Gravity of thirty Ounces sufficeth; I","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"afterwards reduce the said Lead into a flat and thinne Plate, the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"which I likewise put into the water, suspended by three threds, which","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"hold it parallel to the Surface of the water, and putting in the same","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"manner, Weights to the other end, till such time as the Plate comes to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,be raised and drawn out of the water: I finde that thirty six ounces,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"will not suffice to seperate it from the water, and raise it thorow","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the Air: and arguing from this Experiment, I affirm, that I have fully","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,demonstrated the truth of my Proposition. Here my Oponents desires me,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to look down, shewing me a thing which I had not before observed, to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"wit, that in the Ascent of the Plate out of the water, it draws after","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"it another Plate (_if I may so call it_) of water, which before it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"divides and parts from the inferiour Surface of the Plate of Lead, is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"raised above the Levell of the other water, more than the thickness of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the back of a Knife: Then he goeth to repeat the Experiment with the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Ball, and makes me see, that it is but a very small quantity of water,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,which cleaves to its compacted and contracted Figure: and then he,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"subjoynes, that its no wonder, if in seperating the thinne and broad","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Plate from the water, we meet with much greater Resistance, than in","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"seperating the Ball, since together with the Plate, we are to raise a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"great quantity of water, which occurreth not in the Ball: He telleth","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"me moreover, how that our Question is, whether the Resistance of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Elevation be greater in a dilated Plate of Lead, than in a Ball, and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,not whether more resisteth a Plate of Lead with a great quantity of,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, or a Ball with a very little water: He sheweth me in the close,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that the putting the Plate and the Ball first into the water, to make","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"proofe thereby of their Resistance in the Air, is besides our case,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"which treats of Elivating in the Air, and of things placed in the Air,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,and not of the Resistance that is made in the Confines of the Air and,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, and by things which are part in Air and part in water: and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"lastly, they make me feel with my hand, that when the thinne Plate is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in the Air, and free from the weight of the water, it is raised with","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the very same Force that raiseth the Ball. Seeing, and understanding","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"these things, I know not what to do, unless to grant my self","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"convinced, and to thank such a Friend, for having made me to see that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"which I never till then observed: and, being advertised by this same","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Accident, to tell my Adversaries, that our Question is, whether a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Board and a Ball of Ebony, equally go to the bottom in water, and not","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"a Ball of Ebony and a Board of Ebony, joyned with another flat Body of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Air: and, farthermore, that we speak of sinking, and not sinking to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the bottom, in water, and not of that which happeneth in the Confines","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of the water and Air to Bodies that be part in the Air, and part in","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the water; nor much less do we treat of the greater or lesser Force,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,requisite in seperating this or that Body from the Air; not omitting,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to tell them, in the last place, that the Air doth resist, and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"gravitate downwards in the water, just so much as the water (if I may","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"so speak) gravitates and resists upwards in the Air, and that the same","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Force is required to sinke a Bladder under water, that is full of Air,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"as to raise it in the Air, being full of water, removing the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"consideration of the weight of that Filme or Skinne, and considering","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the water and the Air only. And it is likewise true, that the same","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Force is required to sink a Cup or such like Vessell under water,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"whilst it is full of Air, as to raise it above the Superficies of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, keeping it with the mouth downwards; whilst it is full of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, which is constrained in the same manner to follow the Cup which","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"contains it, and to rise above the other water into the Region of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Air, as the Air is forced to follow the same Vessell under the Surface","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of the water, till that in this c{a}se the water, surmounting the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"brimme of the Cup, breaks in, driving thence the Air, and in that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"case, the said brimme coming out of the water, and arriving to the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Confines of the Air, the water falls down, and the Air sub-enters to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"fill the cavity of the Cup: upon which ensues, that he no less","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"transgresses the Articles of the _Convention_, who produceth a Plate","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"conjoyned with much Air, to see if it descend to the bottom in water,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,then he that makes proof of the Resistance against Elevation in Air,"Galilei, Galileo"

37729,_Aristotle_ hath writ of this matter towards the end of his Book De,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Caelo[79]; wherein I shall note two things: the one that it being true as,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"hath been demonstrated, that Figure hath nothing to do about the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"moving or not moving it self upwards or downwards, its seemes that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_Aristotle_ at his first falling upon this Speculation, was of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"same opinion, as in my opinion may be collected from the examination","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of his words. 'Tis true, indeed, that in essaying afterwards to render","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"a reason of such effect, as not having in my conceit hit upon the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"right, (which in the second place I will examine) it seems that he is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"brought to admit the largenesse of Figure, to be interessed in this","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"operation. As to the first particuler, hear the precise words of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,_Aristotle_.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,    [79] _Aristot. de Caelo_ Lib. 4. Cap 6.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_Figures are not the Causes of moving simply upwards or downwards, but","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of moving more slowly or swiftly[80][81], and by what means this comes to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"pass, it is not difficult to see._","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"    [80] _Aristotle_ makes not Figure the cause of Motion absolutely,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"    but of swift or slow motion,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,    [81] Lib. 4. Cap. 6: Text. 42.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Here first I note, that the terms being four, which fall under the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"present consideration, namely, Motion, Rest, Slowly and Swiftly: And","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_Aristotle_ naming figures as Causes of Tardity and Velocity,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"excluding them from being the Cause of absolute and simple Motion, it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"seems necessary, that he exclude them on the other side, from being","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the Cause of Rest, so that his meaning is this. Figures are not the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Causes of moving or not moving absolutely, but of moving quickly or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"slowly: and, here, if any should say the mind of _Aristotle_ is to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"exclude Figures from being Causes of Motion, but yet not from being","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Causes of Rest, so that the sence would be to remove from Figures,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"there being the Causes of moving simply, but yet not there being","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Causes of Rest, I would demand, whether we ought with _Aristotle_ to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"understand, that all Figures universally, are, in some manner, the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"causes of Rest in those Bodies, which otherwise would move, or else","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"some particular Figures only, as for Example, broad and thinne","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Figures: If all indifferently, then every Body shall rest: because","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"every Body hath some Figure, which is false; but if some particular","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Figures only may be in some manner a Cause of Rest, as, for Example,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the broad, then the others would be in some manner the Causes of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Motion: for if from seeing some Bodies of a contracted Figure move,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"which after dilated into Plates rest, may be inferred, that the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Amplitude of Figure hath a part in the Cause of that Rest; so from,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"seeing such like Figures rest, which afterwards contracted move, it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"may with the same reason be affirmed, that the united and contracted","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Figure, hath a part in causing Motion, as the remover of that which","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,impeded it: The which again is directly opposite to what _Aristotle_,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"saith, namely, that Figures are not the Causes of Motion. Besides, if","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,_Aristotle_ had admitted and not excluded Figures from being Causes of,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"not moving in some Bodies, which moulded into another Figure would","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"move, he would have impertinently propounded in a dubitative manner,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in the words immediately following, whence it is, that the large and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"thinne Plates of Lead or Iron, rest upon the water, since the Cause","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"was apparent, namely, the Amplitude of Figure. Let us conclude,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"therefore, that the meaning of _Aristotle_ in this place is to affirm,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that Figures are not the Causes of absolutely moving or not moving,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,but only of moving swiftly or slowly: which we ought the rather to,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"believe, in regard it is indeed a most true conceipt and opinion. Now","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the mind of _Aristotle_ being such, and appearing by consequence,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"rather contrary at the first sight, then favourable to the assertion","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of the Oponents, it is necessary, that their Interpretation be not","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"exactly the same with that, but such, as being in part understood by","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"some of them, and in part by others, was set down: and it may easily","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"be indeed so, being an Interpretation consonent to the sence of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"more famous Interpretors, which is, that the Adverbe _Simply_ or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_Absolutely_, put in the Text, ought not to be joyned to the Verbe to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_Move_, but with the Noun _Causes_: so that the purport of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_Aristotles_ words, is to affirm, That Figures are not the Causes","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"absolutely of moving or not moving, but yet are Causes _Secundum","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"quid_, _viz._ in some sort; by which means, they are called Auxiliary","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,and Concomitant Causes: and this Proposition is received and asserted,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,as true by _Signor Buonamico Lib. 5. Cap. 28._ where he thus writes.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_There are other Causes concomitant, by which some things float, and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"others sink, among which the Figures of Bodies hath the first place_,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,&c.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Concerning this Proposition, I meet with many doubts and difficulties,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,for which me thinks the words of _Aristotle_ are not capable of such a,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"construction and sence, and the difficulties are these.","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"First in the order and disposure of the words of _Aristotle_, the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"particle _Simpliciter_, or if you will _absolute_, is conjoyned with","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the Verb _to move_, and seperated from the Noun _Causes_, the which is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"a great presumption in my favour, seeing that the writing and the Text","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"saith, Figures are not the Cause of moving simply upwards or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"downwards, but of quicker or slower Motion: and, saith not, Figures","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"are not simply the Causes of moving upwards or downwards, and when the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"words of a Text receive, transposed, a sence different from that which","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"they sound, taken in the order wherein the Author disposeth them, it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,is not convenient to inverte them. And who will affirm that,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_Aristotle_ desiring to write a Proposition, would dispose the words","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in such sort, that they should import a different, nay, a contrary","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"sence? contrary, I say, because understood as they are written; they","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"say, that Figures are not the Causes of Motion, but inverted, they","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"say, that Figures are the Causes of Motion, &c.","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Moreover, if the intent of _Aristotle_ had been to say, that Figures","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"are not simply the Causes of moving upwards or downwards, but only","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Causes _Secundum quid_, he would not have adjoyned those words, _but","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"they are Causes of the more swift or slow Motion_; yea, the subjoining","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"this would have been not only superfluous but false, for that the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,whole tenour of the Proposition would import thus much. Figures are,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"not the absolute Causes of moving upwards or downwards, but are the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,absolute Cause of the swift or slow Motion; which is not true: because,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the primary Causes of greater or lesser Velocity, are by _Aristotle_","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in the 4th of his _Physicks_, _Text. 71._ attributed to the greater or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"lesser Gravity of Moveables, compared among themselves, and to the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"greater or lesser Resistance of the _Medium's_, depending on their","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,greater or less Crassitude: and these are inserted by _Aristotle_ as,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the primary Causes; and these two only are in that place nominated:,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"and Figure comes afterwards to be considered, _Text. 74._ rather as an","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Instrumentall Cause of the force of the Gravity, the which divides","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"either with the Figure, or with the _Impetus_; and, indeed, Figure by","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"it self without the force of Gravity or Levity, would opperate","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,nothing.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"I adde, that if _Aristotle_ had an opinion that Figure had been in","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"some sort the Cause of moving or not moving, the inquisition which he","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"makes immediately in a doubtfull manner, whence it comes, that a Plate","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of Lead flotes, would have been impertinent; for if but just before he","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"had said, that Figure was in a certain sort the Cause of moving or not","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"moving, he needed not to call in Question, by what Cause the Plate of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Lead swims, and then ascribing the Cause to its Figure; and framing a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,discourse in this manner. Figure is a Cause _Secundum quid_ of not,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"sinking: but, now, if it be doubted, for what Cause a thin Plate of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Lead goes not to the bottom; it shall be answered, that that proceeds","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,more in _Aristotle_; For where is the occasion of doubting? And who,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"sees not, that if _Aristotle_ had held, that Figure was in some sort a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Cause of Natation, he would without the least Hesitation have writ;","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"That Figure is in a certain sort the Cause of Natation, and therefore","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the Plate of Lead in respect of its large and expatiated Figure swims;,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"but if we take the proposition of _Aristotle_ as I say, and as it is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"written, and as indeed it is true, the ensuing words come in very","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"oppositely, as well in the introduction of swift and slow, as in the","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,much.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"Cause is doubtfull, whence it proceeds, that a Plate of Lead or of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Iron broad and thin doth swim, &c. And the occasion of the doubt is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"obvious, because it seems at the first glance, that the Figure is the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Cause of this Natation, since the same Lead, or a less quantity, but","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in another Figure, goes to the bottom, and we have already affirmed,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,that the Figure hath no share in this effect.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Lastly, if the intent of _Aristotle_ in this place had been to say,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that Figures, although not absolutely, are at least in some measure","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the Cause of moving or not moving: I would have it considered, that he","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"names no less the Motion upwards, than the other downwards: and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"because in exemplifying it afterwards, he produceth no other","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Experiments than of a Plate of Lead, and Board of Ebony, Matters that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of their own Nature go to the bottom, but by vertue (as our","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"since this is impossible to be done, we conclude, that _Aristotle_ in","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"_Aristotle_ having propounded the Question, whence it proceeds, that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"broad Plates of Iron or Lead, float or swim; he addeth (as it were","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"less, and less grave, be they round or long, as for instance a Needle","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"go to the bottom. Now I here doubt, or rather am certain that a Needle","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"put lightly upon the water, rests afloat, no less than the thin Plates","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of Iron or Lead. I cannot believe, albeit it hath been told me, that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"some to defend _Aristotle_ should say, that he intends a Needle","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"demitted not longwayes but endwayes, and with the Point downwards;","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"nevertheless, not to leave them so much as this, though very weak","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"refuge, and which in my judgement _Aristotle_ himself would refuse, I","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"say it ought to be understood, that the Needle must be demitted,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"according to the Dimension named by _Aristotle_, which is the length:","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"because, if any other Dimension than that which is named, might or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"ought to be taken, I would say, that even the Plates of Iron and Lead,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"sink to the bottom, if they be put into the water edgewayes and not","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"flatwayes. But because _Aristotle_ saith, broad Figures go not to the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"bottom, it is to be understood, being demitted broadwayes: and,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"therefore, when he saith, long Figures as a Needle, albeit light, rest","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"not afloat, it ought to be understood of them when demitted longwayes.","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  _Moreover, to say that_ Aristotle _is to be understood of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Needle demitted with the Point downwards, is to father upon him a","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"  folly would it be to subjoyn, that neither would a Needle demitted","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  endwayes swim? And what other is such a Needle, but many such like","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  Graines accumulated one upon another? It was too unworthy of such a,"Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"  neither can it swim, though you put a hundred more upon it._","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Lastly, either _Aristotle_ believed, that a Needle demitted longwayes","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"he believed it would not swim, he might well speak as indeed he did;","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"proceeds, that even long and slender Figures, howbeit of Iron or Lead","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"do swim? And the rather, for that the occasion of doubting seems","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"whilst he saith, that were it true, that the calid ascending Atomes,","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"judgement seems to give occasion of suspecting, that he may possibly","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"Atomes, (whether they be Fiery Corpuscles, or whether they be","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Exhalations, or in short, whatever other matter they be, that ascends","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,upwards through the Air) cannot be believed to mount faster through,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Air, than through water: but rather on the contrary, they peradventure","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"move more impetuously through the water, than through the Air, as hath","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"been in part demonstrated above. And here I cannot finde the reason,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"why _Aristotle_ seeing, that the descending Motion of the same","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Moveable, is more swift in Air, than in water, hath not advertised us,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that from the contrary Motion, the contrary should necessarily follow;","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to wit, that it is more swift in the water, than in the Air: for since","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that the Moveable which descendeth, moves swifter through the Air,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"than through the water, if we should suppose its Gravity gradually to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"diminish, it would first become such, that descending swiftly through","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the Air, it would descend but slowly through the water: and then","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"again, it might be such, that descending in the Air, it should ascend","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in the water: and being made yet less grave, it shall ascend swiftly","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"We must needs say then, either that in the water, there are no such","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"_Democritus_ speaks is one, and that of the Supernatation of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"things of which we speak is another. But, returning to _Aristotle_[86],","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"methinks that he hath more weakly confuted _Democritus_, than","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,_Democritus_ himself hath done: For _Aristotle_ having propounded the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Objection which he maketh against him, and opposed him with saying,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,that if the calid ascendent Corpuscles were those that raised the thin,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Plate, much more then would such a Solid be raised and born upwards","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"through the Air, it sheweth that the desire in _Aristotle_ to detect","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_Democritus_, was predominate over the exquisiteness of Solid","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Philosophizing: which desire of his he hath discovered in other,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"occasions, and that we may not digress too far from this place, in the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Text precedent to this Chapter which we have in hand[87]; where he,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"attempts to confute the same _Democritus_ for that he, not contenting","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"himself with names only, had essayed more particularly to declare what","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"things Gravity and Levity were; that is, the Causes of descending and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"ascending, (and had introduced Repletion and Vacuity) ascribing this","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to Fire, by which it moves upwards, and that to the Earth, by which it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"descends; afterwards attributing to the Air more of Fire, and to the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water more of Earth. But _Aristotle_ desiring a positive Cause, even","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of ascending Motion, and not as _Plato_, or these others, a simple","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"negation, or privation, such as Vacuity would be in reference to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Repletion[88], argueth against _Democritus_ and saith: If it be true, as","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"you suppose, then there shall be a great Mass of water, which shall","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"have more of Fire, than a small Mass of Air, and a great Mass of Air,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"which shall have more of Earth than a little Mass of water, whereby it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"would ensue, that a great Mass of Air, should come more swiftly","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"downwards, than a little quantity of water: But that is never in any","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,case soever: Therefore _Democritus_ discourseth erroneously.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,    [86] _Aristotle_ shews his desire of finding _Democritus_ in an,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"    Error, to exceed that of discovering Truth.","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"But in my opinion, the Doctrine of _Democritus_ is not by this","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"deduction either concludes not, or if it do conclude any thing, it may","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,with equall force be restored against himself. _Democritus_ will grant,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to _Aristotle_, that there may be a great Mass of Air taken, which","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"contains more Earth, than a small quantity of water, but yet will","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"deny, that such a Mass of Air, shall go faster downwards than a little","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, and that for many reasons. First, because if the greater","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"quantity of Earth, contained in the great Mass of Air, ought to cause","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"a greater Velocity than a less quantity of Earth, contained in a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"little quantity of water, it would be necessary, first, that it were","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"true, that a greater Mass of pure Earth, should move more swiftly than","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"a less: But this is false, though _Aristotle_ in many places affirms","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"it to be true: because not the greater absolute, but the greater","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"specificall Gravity, is the cause of greater Velocity[89]: nor doth a Ball","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of Wood, weighing ten pounds, descend more swiftly than one weighing","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"ten Ounces, and that is of the same Matter: but indeed a Bullet of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Lead of four Ounces, descendeth more swiftly than a Ball of Wood of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,twenty Pounds: because the Lead is more _grave in specie_ than the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Wood. Therefore, its not necessary, that a great Mass of Air, by","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"reason of the much Earth contained in it, do descend more swiftly than","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"a little Mass of water[90], but on the contrary, any whatsoever Mass of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, shall move more swiftly than any other of Air, by reason the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,participation of the terrene parts _in specie_ is greater in the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, than in the Air. Let us note, in the second place, how that in","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"multiplying the Mass of the Air, we not only multiply that which is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"therein of terrene, but its Fire also: whence the Cause of ascending,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"no less encreaseth, by vertue of the Fire, than that of descending on","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the account of its multiplied Earth. It was requisite in increasing,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the greatness of the Air, to multiply that which it hath of terrene","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"only, leaving its Fire in its first state, for then the terrene parts","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of the augmented Air, overcoming the terrene parts of the small","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"quantity of water, it might with more probability have been pretended,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that the great quantity of Air, ought to descend with a greater","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_Impetus_, than the little quantity of water.","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"    [89] The greater Specificall, not the greater absolute Gravity,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,    is the Cause of Velocity.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"    [90] Any Mass of water shal move more swiftly, than any of Air,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,    and why.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Therefore, the Fallacy lyes more in the Discourse of _Aristotle_, than","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in that of _Democritus_, who with severall other Reasons might oppose","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_Aristotle_, and alledge; If it be true, that the extreame Elements be","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"one simply grave, and the other simply light, and that the mean","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Elements participate of the one, and of the other Nature; but the Air","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"more of Levity, and the water more of Gravity, then there shall be a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"great Mass of Air, whose Gravity shall exceed the Gravity of a little","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"quantity of water, and therefore such a Mass of Air shall descend more","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,swiftly than that little water: But that is never seen to occurr:,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Therefore its not true, that the mean Elements do participate of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"one, and the other quality. This argument is fallacious, no less than","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the other against _Democritus_.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Lastly, _Aristotle_ having said, that if the Position of _Democritus_","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"were true, it would follow, that a great Mass of Air should move more","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"swiftly than a small Mass of water, and afterwards subjoyned, that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,that is never seen in any Case: methinks others may become desirous to,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"know of him in what place this should evene, which he deduceth against","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_Democritus_, and what Experiment teacheth us, that it never falls out","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"so. To suppose to see it in the Element of water, or in that of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Air is vain, because neither doth water through water, nor Air through","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Air move, nor would they ever by any whatever participation others","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"assign them, of Earth or of Fire: the Earth, in that it is not a Body","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"fluid, and yielding to the mobility of other Bodies, is a most","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"improper place and _Medium_ for such an Experiment: _Vacuum_,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"according to the same _Aristotle_ himself, there is none, and were","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"there, nothing would move in it: there remains the Region of Fire, but","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"being so far distant from us, what Experiment can assure us, or hath","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"assertained _Aristotle_ in such sort, that he should as of a thing","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"most obvious to sence, affirm what he produceth in confutation of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"_Democritus_, to wit, that a great Mass of Air, is moved no swifter","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,than a little one of water? But I will dwell no longer upon this,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"matter, whereon I have spoke sufficiently: but leaving _Democritus_, I","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"return to the Text of _Aristotle_, wherein he goes about to render the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"true reason, how it comes to pass, that the thin Plates of Iron or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Lead do swim on the water; and, moreover, that Gold it self being","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"beaten into thin Leaves, not only swims in water, but flyeth too and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"again in the Air. He supposeth that of Continualls[91], some are easily","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"divisible, others not: and that of the easily divisible, some are more","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"so, and some less: and these he affirms we should esteem the Causes.","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"He addes that that is easily divisible, which is well terminated, and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the more the more divisible, and that the Air is more so, than the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, and the water than the Earth. And, lastly, supposeth that in","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"each kind, the lesse quantity is easlyer divided and broken than the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,greater.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,    [91] _De Caelo_ l. 4. c. 6. t. 44.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Here I note, that the Conclusions of _Aristotle_ in generall are all","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"true, but methinks, that he applyeth them to particulars, in which","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"they have no place, as indeed they have in others, as for Example, Wax","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"is more easily divisible than Lead, and Lead than Silver, inasmuch as","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Wax receives all the terms more easlier than Lead, and Lead than","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Silver. Its true, moreover, that a little quantity of Silver is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,easlier divided than a great Mass: and all these Propositions are,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"true, because true it is, that in Silver, Lead and Wax, there is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"simply a Resistance against Division, and where there is the absolute,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"there is also the respective. But if as well in water as in Air, there","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"be no Renitence against simple Division, how can we say, that the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,water is easlier divided than the Air? We know not how to extricate,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"our selves from the Equivocation: whereupon I return to answer, that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Resistance of absolute Division is one thing, and Resistance of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Division made with such and such Velocity is another. But to produce,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Rest, and to abate the Motion, the Resistance of absolute Division is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"necessary; and the Resistance of speedy Division, causeth not Rest,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"but slowness of Motion. But that as well in the Air, as in water,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"there is no Resistance of simple Division, is manifest, for that there","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"is not found any Solid Body which divides not the Air, and also the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water: and that beaten Gold, or small dust, are not able to superate","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the Resistance of the Air, is contrary to that which Experience shews","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"us, for we see Gold and Dust to go waving to and again in the Air, and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"at last to descend downwards, and to do the same in the water, if it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"be put therein, and separated from the Air. And, because, as I say,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"neither the water, nor the Air do resist simple Division, it cannot be","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"said, that the water resists more than the Air. Nor let any object","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"unto me, the Example of most light Bodies, as a Feather, or a little","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of the pith of Elder, or water-reed that divides the Air and not the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, and from this infer, that the Air is easlier divisible than the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water; for I say unto them, that if they do well observe, they shall","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"see the same Body likewise divide the Continuity of the water[92], and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"submerge in part, and in such a part, as that so much water in Mass","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,would weigh as much as the whole Solid. And if they shal yet persist,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in their doubt, that such a Solid sinks not through inability to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"divide the water, I will return them this reply, that if they put it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"under water, and then let it go, they shall see it divide the water,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"and presently ascend with no less celerity, than that with which it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,divided the Air in descending: so that to say that this Solid ascends,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in the Air, but that coming to the water, it ceaseth its Motion, and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"therefore the water is more difficult to be divided, concludes","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"nothing: for I, on the contrary, will propose them a piece of Wood, or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of Wax, which riseth from the bottom of the water, and easily divides","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"its Resistance, which afterwards being arrived at the Air, stayeth","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"there, and hardly toucheth it; whence I may aswell say, that the water","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,is more easier divided than the Air.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,    [92] _Archimed. De Insident. humi_ lib. 2. prop. 1.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,I will not on this occasion forbear to give warning of another fallacy,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of these persons, who attribute the reason of sinking or swimming to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the greater or lesse Resistance of the Crassitude of the water against,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Division, making use of the example of an Egg, which in sweet water","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"goeth to the bottom, but in salt water swims; and alledging for the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"cause thereof, the faint Resistance of fresh water against Division,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"and the strong Resistance of salt water. But if I mistake not, from","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the same Experiment, we may aswell deduce the quite contrary; namely,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that the fresh water is more dense, and the salt more tenuous and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"subtle, since an Egg from the bottom of salt water speedily ascends to","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the top, and divides its Resistance, which it cannot do in the fresh,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in whose bottom it stays, being unable to rise upwards. Into such like","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"perplexities, do false Principles Lead men: but he that rightly","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Philosophating, shall acknowledge the excesses of the Gravities of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Moveables and of the Mediums, to be the Causes of those effects, will","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"say, that the Egg sinks to the bottom in fresh water, for that it is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"more grave than it, and swimeth in the salt, for that its less grave","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"than it: and shall without any absurdity, very solidly establish his","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,Conclusions.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Therefore the reason totally ceaseth, that _Aristotle_ subjoyns in the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Text saying[93]; The things, therefore, which have great breadth remain","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"above, because they comprehend much, and that which is greater, is not","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"easily divided. Such discoursing ceaseth, I say, because its not true,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,that there is in water or in Air any Resistance of Division; besides,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that the Plate of Lead when it stays, hath already divided and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"penetrated the Crassitude of the water, and profounded it self ten or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,twelve times more than its own thickness: besides that such Resistance,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of Division, were it supposed to be in the water, could not rationally","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"be affirmed to be more in its superiour parts than in the middle, and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"lower: but if there were any difference, the inferiour should be the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"more dense, so that the Plate would be no less unable to penetrate the","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"Piece of Wood, but it precipitatly, and without any retension,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,descends to the bottom.,"Galilei, Galileo"

37729,    [93] Text 45.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"I believe not after all this, that any (thinking perhaps thereby to","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"resists more than the little, the said Board being put lower","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"descendeth, because there remaineth a less Mass of water to be divided","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,by it: because if after the having seen the same Board swim in four,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Inches of water, and also after that in the same to sink, he shall try","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"the same Experiment upon a profundity of ten or twenty fathom water,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,he shall see the very self same effect. And here I will take occasion,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to remember, for the removall of an Error that is too common; That","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that Ship or other whatsoever Body, that on the depth of an hundred or","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"a thousand fathom, swims with submerging only six fathom of its own","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"height, [_or in the Sea dialect, that draws six fathom water_] shall","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"swim in the same manner in water, that hath but six fathom and half an","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Inch of depth[94]. Nor do I on the other side, think that it can be said,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that the superiour parts of the water are the more dense, although a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,most grave Authour hath esteemed the superiour water in the Sea to be,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"so, grounding his opinion upon its being more salt, than that at the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"bottom: but I doubt the Experiment, whether hitherto in taking the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water from the bottom, the Observatour did not light upon some spring","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of fresh water there spouting up: but we plainly see on the contrary,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,the fresh Waters of Rivers to dilate themselves for some miles beyond,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"their place of meeting with the salt water of the Sea, without","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"descending in it, or mixing with it, unless by the intervention of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,some commotion or turbulency of the Windes.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"    [94] A Ship that in 100 Fathome water draweth 6 Fathome, shall","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"But returning to _Aristotle_, I say, that the breadth of Figure hath","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"nothing to do in this business more or less, because the said Plate of","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"Figures more narrow and short, would much better swim than the more","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"And for declaration of what I say, consider that when a thin Plate of","Galilei, Galileo"

37729,"Geometry, will comprehend, not only that a Board sawed in many long","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"thin pieces, will much better float than when it was entire, but that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"all Figures, the more short and narrow they be, shall so much the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"better swim. Let the Board A B C D be, for Example, eight Palmes long,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"and five broad, its circuit shall be twenty six Palmes; and so many","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"must the incession be, which it shall make in the water to descend","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"therein: but if we do saw ir, as suppose into eight little pieces,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"according to the Lines E F, G H, {&}c. making seven Segments, we must","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"adde to the twenty six Palmes of the circuit of the whole Board,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,seventy others; whereupon the eight little pieces so cut and,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"seperated, have to cut ninty six Palmes of water. And, if moreover, we","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"cut each of the said pieces into five parts, reducing them into","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Squares, to the circuit of ninty six Palmes, with four cuts of eight","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Palmes apiece; we shall adde also sixty four Palmes, whereupon the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"said Squares to descend in the water, must divide one hundred and","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"sixty Palmes of water, but the Resistance is much greater than that of","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"twenty six; therefore to the lesser Superficies, we shall reduce them,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,so much the more easily will they float: and the same will happen in,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"all other Figures, whose Superficies are simular amongst themselves,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"but different in bigness: because the said Superficies, being either","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"deminished or encreased, always diminish or encrease their Perimeters","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"in subduple proportion; to wit, the Resistance that they find in","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"penetrating the water; therefore the little pieces gradually swim,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,with more and more facility as their breadth is lessened.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,[Illustration],"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  _This is manifest; for keeping still the same height of the Solid,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  with the same proportion as the Base encreaseth or deminisheth,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,  doth the said Solid also encrease or diminish; whereupon the Solid,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  more diminishing than the Circuit, the Cause of Submersion more","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  diminisheth than the Cause of Natation: And on the contrary, the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  Solid more encreasing than the Circuit, the Cause of Submersion","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"  encreaseth more, that of Natation less._","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,And this may all be deduced out of the Doctrine of _Aristotle_ against,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,his own Doctrine.,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Lastly, to that which we read in the latter part of the Text[97], that is","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to say, that we must compare the Gravity of the Moveable with the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Resistance of the Medium against Division, because if the force of the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Gravity exceed the Resistance of the _Medium_, the Moveable will","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"descend, if not it will float. I need not make any other answer, but","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"that which hath been already delivered; namely, that its not the","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"Resistance of absolute Division, (which neither is in Water nor Air)","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,but the Gravity of the _Medium_ that must be compared with the Gravity,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"of the Moveables; and if that of the _Medium_ be greater, the Moveable","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"shall not descend, nor so much as make a totall Submersion, but a","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,partiall only; because in the place which it would occupy in the,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"water, there must not remain a Body that weighs less than a like","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"quantity of water: but if the Moveable be more grave, it shall descend","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to the bottom, and possess a place where it is more conformable for it","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"to remain, than another Body that is less grave. And this is the only","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"true proper and absolute Cause of Natation and Submersion, so that","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,nothing else hath part therein: and the Board of the Adversaries,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,"swimmeth, when it is conjoyned with as much Air, as, together with it,","Galilei, Galileo"
37729,doth form a Body less grave than so much water as would fill the place,"Galilei, Galileo"
37729,that the said Compound occupyes in the water; but when they shall,"Galilei, Galileo"
